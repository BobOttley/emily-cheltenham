This includes a firm commitment to ensuring that modern slavery and human trafficking do not take place within our institution or in the supply chains we engage with. This statement, in compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015, sets out the actions Cheltenham College has taken during the financial year to address and prevent modern slavery and human trafficking. Our Organisational Structure and Supply Chains Cheltenham College is an independent, co-educational school that provides a comprehensive education to children and young adults. Our supply chains involve a range of goods and services, from educational supplies to catering, facilities management, and construction services. We periodically review our suppliers, ensuring they align with our values, particularly where our suppliers have overseas links in their supply chain. Our Policies on Modern Slavery Cheltenham College has adopted policies to ensure that modern slavery and human trafficking are not part of our operations: • Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy: Close scrutiny is given to the wellbeing of all of our pupils. Any safeguarding concerns relating to pupils (including overseas pupils) are referred to the appropriate authority • Code of Conduct for Suppliers: All suppliers are expected to have high ethical standards, including ensuring that their operations are free from forced labour, child labour, and human trafficking.

Governance FAQs How does the Council of Cheltenham College differ from a Board of Governors? In many respects, it doesn’t. The ‘Council’ is simply the name given to the governing body of College by the Cheltenham College Act 1894, the document that established the basis of our constitution as we know it today. The ‘Council’ is a name that’s an important part of our heritage and we have continued to use it to this day. Unlike the Board of Governors of a Local Authority maintained school, however, Governors of independent schools are often charity trustees too, and that’s certainly the case for members of the Council of Cheltenham College. Do the College and The Prep ‘share’ the Council or does each school have its own governing body? The Council is the governing body of both schools. Its membership includes specialists across the full 3-18 age range so there is no bias towards either school. The Council provides a strong link and source of balance between the two"}

Do the College and The Prep ‘share’ the Council or does each school have its own governing body? The Council is the governing body of both schools. Its membership includes specialists across the full 3-18 age range so there is no bias towards either school. The Council provides a strong link and source of balance between the two schools ensuring that the needs and aspirations of each are properly taken into account whilst at the same time providing leadership that has the interests of Cheltenham College as a whole (College and The Prep) at its heart. Why a ‘President’ rather than a Chair of Governors? Once again, this is purely a matter of tradition and is based on the terminology formalised by the Cheltenham College Act of 1894. The President of Council could also correctly be referred to as the Chair of the Board of Governors, or the Chair of Trustees. How many members make up the full College Council? The Council will normally include six nominated members and between 13 and 18 co-opted members. ‘Full’ membership can therefore range between 19 and 24 members. The nominated members are the nominees of the Cheltonian Society, the Common Rooms of both schools (though they may not be current members of teaching staff), and three top universities. How are Council members recruited and selected? The Secretary to Council maintains a ‘skills matrix’ that identifies the mix of skills and experience that the Council should ideally have represented by its membership. Council members complete a ‘skills audit’ that allows the Secretary and the Membership and Governance Committee to monitor and predict how well the membership actually reflects the ideal established by the skills matrix. Where gaps, present or predicted, are identified, suitably experienced and qualified candidates are sought. We take a positive approach to diversity and welcome expressions of interest from individuals interested in joining Council, free from bias on the grounds of characteristics such as race, gender, sexual orientation, race or belief, marital status etc. Council members are selected on the basis of merit alone. How much are Council members paid? Nothing. Council membership is a substantial, but entirely voluntary, commitment. In contrast to many paid non-executive directorships in the commercial world, members of the Council may only claim minor incidental expenses. So why do the members of Council take on the many responsibilities, not to mention the drain on their time, that go with the role? The answer usually lies in the very real sense of satisfaction and purpose that accompanies being an important part of a great school like Cheltenham College: knowing that young people will thrive, in part because of your leadership input as a Council member, brings its own rewards. How long do Council members serve for – is it a ‘job for life’? Members are appointed for a term of three years and, subject to the approval of Council, that initial three-year term can be renewed twice. The resultant maximum nine-year term of office means there’s always a healthy turnover of membership bringing a good balance of fresh ideas and energy alongside consistency and stability. The President of Council, selected by the members, may serve for up to two terms of five years in addition to any period as an ordinary member. What part does the Council play in the day-to-day running of the schools? The day-to-day running of College is very much the work of the Heads, the Bursar and their Senior Management Teams. Council members take great care not to tread on the toes of the executive team and have little involvement in the day-to-day operational management of the schools. The Council’s role is clearly focused on governance: setting the strategic direction, vision and values of College and then holding the executive team to account for their delivery. Who is the Council answerable to? To the Department for Education in its role as a board of school governors and to the Charity Commission"}

Who is the Council answerable to? To the Department for Education in its role as a board of school governors and to the Charity Commission in respect of its work as a group of charity trustees. The Department for Education arranges for the inspection of registered schools in the UK. In our case that inspection is undertaken by the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) . Please click here if you would like to see the latest inspection reports for The Prep or College. How does the Council operate – is it all very secretive, and ‘behind closed doors’? Generally speaking, not secretive at all. Inevitably some topics discussed at Council meetings are sufficiently confidential that it would be inappropriate to publish Council minutes in detail – matters relating to staff remuneration would be a good example. However most Council business is not particularly confidential and John Champion , the Secretary to Council, will be happy to talk with interested parents/fee-payers about any non-sensitive issues currently on the Council’s agenda.

Introduction Cheltenham College is committed to providing the best possible care and education to its pupils and to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children and young people. College is also committed to providing a supportive and flexible working environment to all its members of staff. College recognises that, in order to achieve these aims, it is of fundamental importance to attract, recruit and retain staff of the highest calibre who share this commitment. All queries on the School’s Application Form and recruitment process must be directed to recruitment@cheltenhamcollege.org. An entry will be made on the Single Central Record for all current members of staff at the School, the proprietorial body and all individuals who work in regular contact with children including volunteers, supply staff and those employed as third parties. The terms ‘Cheltenham College’ or ‘College’ shall include Cheltenham College Senior School, Cheltenham College Preparatory School, Cheltenham College’s Trading Subsidiaries and Cheltenham College Charitable Trust as appropriate.

Scope of This Policy The Recruitment, Selection and Disclosures Policy and Procedure herewith refers and applies to staff directly recruited and employed by the School. In the Education (Independent Schools Standards) (England) Regulations 2014, staff are defined as: “Any person working at College whether under a contract of employment, under a contract for services or otherwise than under a contract, but does not include supply staff 2 or volunteers” 3. Recruitment and selection procedure All applicants for employment will be required to complete an application form containing questions about their academic and employment history and their suitability for the role. Should there be any gaps in academic or employment history, a satisfactory explanation must be provided. A curriculum vitae will not be accepted in place of the completed application form. Vacancies advertised on the College website and on other websites (for example the TES) or in hard copy will make clear that all roles carry a commitment and responsibility for safeguarding children. In addition, applicants for all posts at College will receive a job description and person specification for the role. The following statement is displayed on College’s recruitment pages which all candidates must visit to obtain an application form. Policies referred to are lined from this page for ease of reference: Cheltenham College and Cheltenham College Preparatory School are committed to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children and we expect all staff to share this commitment.

Application forms, job descriptions, person specifications, the Privacy Notice for Staff and the College's Child Protection and Safeguarding Policy are available to download from the College website. College will shortlist applicants according to the relevance and applicability of their professional attributes and personal qualities to the role. At least two people will carry out the shortlisting exercise, consider any inconsistencies, look for gaps in employment and reasons given for them and explore all potential concerns. The applicants may then be invited to attend a formal interview at which their relevant skills and experience will be discussed in more detail. Shortlisted candidates should be asked to complete a self-declaration form in relation to their criminal record or information that would make them unsuitable to work with children. (see further details at 4.3). Candidates with a disability who are invited to interview should inform the School of any necessary reasonable adjustments or arrangements to assist them in attending the interview. All candidates will be asked to bring proof of their identity to the interview (see further details at 4.1). The interview panel will include a member of staff who has been through formal Safer Recruitment training. This training will be renewed every five years. Interviewers must use a selection of the safer recruitment questions provided by Human Resources and return their responses to that department. The President of Council should chair the panel for the Bursar’s/Head’s appointment. 3 The interviewers involved will be required to state any prior personal relationship or knowledge of any of the candidates and a judgement will be made by the Chair as to whether or not an interviewer should withdraw from the panel. Should the Chair have a conflict of interest, the Vice Chair shall decide whether the Chair should withdraw from the panel. The interview will be conducted in person and the areas which it will explore will include suitability to work with children including where appropriate, any discussion of information shared by a candidate in their self-declaration form. In the case of recruitment to key pupil-facing role, pupils will be involved in the recruitment process in a meaningful way. A detailed flowchart is available for staff on the College Digital Zone. The steps followed are normally as follows: If it is decided to make an offer of employment following the formal interview, any such offer will be conditional on the following (where not previously verified): § The agreement of a mutually acceptable start date and the signing of a contract incorporating College's standard terms and conditions of employment; § Verification of the applicant's identity; § The receipt of two references which College considers to be satisfactory (see further detail below); § For a candidate to be employed as a teacher, a check that that the candidate is not subject to a prohibition order issued by the Secretary of State or any sanction or restriction imposed (that remains current) by the historic General Teaching Council for England before its abolition in March 2012; § Where the position amounts to \"regulated activity\" (see below) the receipt of an enhanced Application form receivedShort listing against job description and person specificationCandidates complete criminal convictions declarationCandidates invited for interview and consent confirmed to approach referencesReferences soughtinterview with suitably trained panelOffer made subject to checks described below 4 disclosure from the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) or check on the DBS Update Service which College considers to be satisfactory including confirmation that the applicant is not named on the Children’s Barred List; § Where the successful candidate will be involved in childcare or early years provision, receipt of a signed Staff Suitability Declaration from showing that the candidate is not disqualified from providing childcare as set out in the statutory guidance ‘Disqualification under the Childcare Act 2006 (July 2018)’ (if"}

In addition, for certain roles College will seek the following checks: Management Roles The Secretary of State is able to make directions prohibiting individuals from taking part in independent school management under section 128 of the Education and Skills Act 2008. Keeping Children Safe in Education states that: “management” may include individuals who are members of proprietor bodies (including governors if the governing body is the proprietor body for the school), and such staff positions as follows: head teacher, any teaching positions on the senior leadership team, and any teaching positions which carry a department headship. Whether other individuals such as teachers with additional responsibilities could be prohibited from ‘taking part in management’ depends on the facts of each case. Where the successful candidate will be taking part in the management of College, confirmation that the applicant is not subject to a direction under section 128 of the Education and Skills Act 2008 will be sought. This applies to Council, Senior Leadership Teams (including the Bursar’s Team) and teaching heads of department. Council For a candidate to be employed into a position on our Council a signed “senior charity manager positions: automatic disqualification declaration” will be sought confirming that the candidate is not disqualified from acting in a senior management position for a charity in accordance with the automatic disqualification rules for charities. College is required to carry out an enhanced DBS check for all staff, supply staff and governors who will be engaging in regulated activity. However, College can also carry out an enhanced DBS check on a person who would be carrying out regulated activity but for the fact that they 5 do not carry out their duties frequently enough, i.e. roles that would amount to regulated activity if carried out more frequently. College is not permitted to check the Children's Barred List unless an individual will be engaging in \"regulated activity\". Whether a position amounts to \"regulated activity\" must therefore be considered by College in order to decide which checks are appropriate. It is however likely that in nearly all cases College will be able to carry out an enhanced DBS check and a Children's Barred List check. All applicants should be aware that provision of false information is an offence and could result in the application being rejected or summary dismissal by the School if they have been appointed, and a possible referral to the police and/or DBS. 4.

Pre-employment checks In accordance with the recommendations set out in the prevailing legislation, College carries out a number of pre-employment checks in respect of all prospective employees. 4.1 Verification of identity and address All applicants who are invited to an interview will be required to bring with them evidence of identity, right to work in the UK, address and qualifications as set out below and in the list of valid identity documents provided by the DBS identity checking guidelines (available from the HR Department): § One document from Group 1 (for example a valid passport, biometric residence permit, current driving license photo-card, birth certificate or adoption certificate); and § Two further documents from either of Group 1, Group 2a (trusted government documents) or Group 2b (financial and social history documents), one of which must verify the applicant's current address; and § Original documents confirming any educational and professional qualifications referred to in their application form. College requires that you must show at least one form of identification that has a photo to confirm your identity and that you provide your original birth certificate or certified copy. Where an applicant claims to have changed their name by deed poll or any other means (e.g. marriage, adoption, statutory declaration) they will be required to provide documentary evidence of the change. College requires the date of birth of all applicants (and proof of this) in accordance with prevailing legislation. Proof of date of birth is necessary so that College may verify the identity of, and check for any unexplained discrepancies, in the employment and education history of all applicants. College does not discriminate on the grounds of age. 4.2 References References will be taken up on short-listed candidates prior to interview, where possible. No questions will be asked about health or medical fitness prior to any offer of employment being made. If the candidate does not wish College to take up references in advance of the interview, they should notify College at the time of applying and further consent will then be sought before contacting the referees. 6 All offers of employment will be subject to the receipt of a minimum of two references that are considered satisfactory by College. One of the references must be from the applicant's current or most recent employer and should be provided by a senior member of staff with appropriate authority. If the current or most recent employment does not/did not involve work with children, then the second reference should be from the employer with whom the applicant most recently worked with children. Neither referee should be a relative or someone known to the applicant solely as a friend. All referees will be asked whether they believe the applicant is suitable for the job for which they have applied and whether they have any reason to believe that the applicant is unsuitable to work with children. All referees will be sent a copy of the job description and person specification for the role for which the applicant has applied. If the referee is a current or previous employer, they may also be asked to confirm the following: § The applicant's dates of employment, salary, job title / duties, reason for leaving, performance and disciplinary record; § Whether the applicant has ever been the subject of disciplinary procedures involving issues related to the safety and welfare of children (including any in which the disciplinary sanction has expired), except where the issues were deemed to have resulted from allegations which were found to be false, unsubstantiated, or malicious; § Whether any allegations or concerns have been raised about the applicant that relate to the safety and welfare of children or young people or behaviour towards children or young people, except where the allegation or concerns were found to be false, unsubstantiated, or malicious; Any information about"}

If the candidate is not currently working with children but has done so in the past, we will ask the previous employer about those issues. Where neither the current nor previous employment has involved working with children, we will still ask the current employer about the candidate’s suitability to work with children. Where the candidate has no previous employment history, we may request character references which may include references from the candidate's school or university. College will only accept references obtained directly from the referee and it will not rely on references or testimonials provided by the applicant or on open references or testimonials. College will compare all references with any information given on the application form. Any discrepancies or inconsistencies in the information will be taken up with the applicant and the relevant referee before any appointment is confirmed. College may at its discretion make telephone contact with any referee to verify the details of the written reference provided. This is always done when references are received electronically. 4.3 Criminal records check Shortlisted candidates will be asked to complete a self-declaration form in relation to their criminal record or information that would make them unsuitable to work with children. Self-declaration is subject to Ministry of Justice guidance on the disclosure of criminal records. Applicants will be asked to sign a declaration confirming that the information they have provided is true. Where there is an electronic signature, the shortlisted candidate may physically sign a hard copy of the application at the point of interview. 7 Further details of what should be declared can be found at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-filtering-guidance/dbs-filtering-guide Once a post has been offered then College applies for an enhanced disclosure from the DBS and a check of the Children's Barred List (known as an Enhanced Check for Regulated Activity) or undertakes an online check where the applicant has subscribed to the Update Service, in respect of all positions at College which amount to \"regulated activity\" as defined in the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 (as amended). Where an applicant subscribes to the Update Service, they must give their consent to College to check there have been no changes since the issue of the certificate. College must have sight of the original certificate in order to establish that there were no disclosures and that the level of check is sufficient. A barred list check will still be required. College complies with the provisions of the DBS Code of Practice a copy of which may be accessed at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-code-of-practice The DBS Privacy Policy can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/standard-and-enhanced-dbs-check-privacy-policy/standard-and-enhanced-dbs-check-privacy-policy College requires all applicants to the DBS Service to sign the following statement: I have read the Standard/ Enhanced Check Privacy Policy for applicants https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/standard-and-enhanced-dbs-check-privacy-policy/standard-and-enhanced-dbs-check-privacy-policy and I understand how DBS will process my personal data and the options available to me for submitting an application I confirm that I have read the Cheltenham College Privacy Policy and have had the chance to ask any questions I feel necessary before making this application. The purpose of carrying out an Enhanced Check for Regulated Activity is to identify whether an applicant is barred from working with children by inclusion on the Children's Barred List and to obtain other relevant suitability information. Any position undertaken at, or on behalf of the College will amount to \"regulated activity\" if it is carried out: • Frequently, meaning once a week or more; or • Overnight, meaning between 2.00 am and 6.00 am; or • Provides personal care; or • Satisfies the \"period condition\","}

Roles which are carried out on an unpaid/voluntary basis will only amount to regulated activity if, in addition to the above, they are carried out on an unsupervised basis. It is for College to decide whether a role amounts to \"regulated activity\" taking into account all the relevant circumstances. However, nearly all posts at College amount to regulated activity. Limited exceptions could include an administrative post undertaken on a temporary basis in College office outside of term time or voluntary posts which are supervised. The DBS now issues a DBS disclosure certificate to the subject of the check only, rather than to College. It is a condition of employment with College that the original disclosure certificate is provided to the HR Department within two weeks of it being received by the applicant and that it is considered satisfactory to College. 8 DBS checks will still be requested for applicants with recent periods of overseas residence and those with little or no previous UK residence. These applicants may also be asked to provide further information, including a criminal records check from the relevant jurisdiction(s). The applicant will not be permitted to commence work until the overseas information has been received and is considered satisfactory by College. Where they are deemed necessary, DBS checks and overseas checks must be applied for before the applicant may start work. If there is a delay in receiving a DBS disclosure or overseas check certificate, the Head or Bursar has discretion to allow an individual to begin work under supervision pending receipt of the certificate. This will only be allowed if a written submission of the reason why the start date cannot be delayed has been made to and accepted by the Bursar (via the Director of HR and Payroll) all other checks, including a clear check of the Children's Barred List (where the position amounts to regulated activity), have been completed and once appropriate supervision has been put in place. College will not confirm an appointment until the certificate has been received and has been confirmed to be satisfactory by College. There are limited circumstances where College will accept a check from another educational institution. This is where the new member of staff (“M”) has worked in: (a) A school or a maintained school in England in a position which brought M regularly into contact with children or young persons; (b) A maintained school in England in a position to which M was appointed on or after May 2006 and which did not bring M regularly into contact with children or young persons; or (c) An institution within the further education sector in England or in a 16 to 19 Academy in a position which involved the provision of education or which brought M regularly into contact with children or young persons, during a period which ended not more than three months before M’s appointment. In these circumstances the school may apply for a disclosure but is not required to do so. A new, separate barred list check will be obtained. If disclosure is delayed, at the Bursar and Head’s discretion, a short period of work may be allowed under controlled conditions: • without confirming the appointment; • after a satisfactory check of the barred list if the person will be engaging in regulated activity and all other relevant checks (including any appropriate prohibition checks) having been completed satisfactorily; • provided that the DBS application has been made in advance; • with appropriate safeguards taken (a"}

College will comply with the prevailing legislation in regard to its duties under the Rehabilitation of Offenders regulations and guidance (see below). Where an applicant subscribes to the DBS Update Service the applicant must give us consent to check there have not been changes since the issue of a disclosure certificate. A barred list check will still be required. 9 4.4 Medical Fitness College is legally required to verify the medical fitness of anyone to be appointed to a post at the school, after an offer of employment has been made but before the appointment can be confirmed. It is College’s practice that all applicants to whom an offer of employment has been made, are asked to complete a short questionnaire provided by our independent occupational health providers (currently Gloucestershire NHS Working Well Occupational Health Service). This form asks applicants to answer yes or no to a small number of general questions on their fitness for the specific role they have been offered. Should the candidate declare any health issues, or feel otherwise unable to declare their medical fitness, they will be invited to have a further discussion and/or a more detailed assessment with College’s independent occupational health providers. The information sought will be dependent on the Job Description and the Person Specification for the particular role, together with details of any specific physical or mental requirements of the role e.g., related to specific tasks or exposures, proposed workload, co-curricular activities, layout of College, etc. The information provided will be held in strictest confidence by College’s independent occupational health providers. At the conclusion of the process, College’s independent occupational health providers will make recommendations regarding the applicant’s fitness to undertake the proposed role including any workplace adjustments that may be necessary. College will consider any reasonable adjustments recommended by the occupational health service in consultation with the applicant. The questionnaire (and, where applicable, the report from the occupational health providers) will then be held by College in strictest confidence and processed in accordance with the Recruitment, Selection and Disclosure Policy and Procedure, College’s Data Protection Policy and Staff Privacy Notice. College is aware of its duties under the Equality Act 2010. No job offer will be withdrawn without first consulting with the applicant, obtaining medical evidence from an occupational health provider, and considering reasonable adjustments or suitable alternative employment. If health surveillance is required under the Health and Safety Policy it is likely that there will be a pre-placement/pre-employment fitness for work health assessment. 4.5 Prevent Duty College has a legal duty under section 26 of the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 to have ‘due regard to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism’. This is known at the Prevent duty. Schools are required to assess the risk of children being drawn into terrorism, including support for extremist ideas that are part of terrorist ideology. Accordingly, as part of the recruitment process, when an offer is made the offer will be subject to a Prevent duty risk assessment 4.6 Online and social media due diligence In addition to asking candidates to disclose any unspent convictions, cautions, reprimands or warnings at the time of applying, College may carry out an internet and social media check in advance of shortlisted applicants being interviewed. Shortlisted"}

Schools are required to assess the risk of children being drawn into terrorism, including support for extremist ideas that are part of terrorist ideology. Accordingly, as part of the recruitment process, when an offer is made the offer will be subject to a Prevent duty risk assessment 4.6 Online and social media due diligence In addition to asking candidates to disclose any unspent convictions, cautions, reprimands or warnings at the time of applying, College may carry out an internet and social media check in advance of shortlisted applicants being interviewed. Shortlisted candidates will be informed that online searches may be undertaken as part of due diligence checks (KCSiE 2024) This 10 search will be conducted on the applicant’s full name and any previous names known to College and will be carried out in order to establish: • if there is a potentially undeclared conviction; and • that the applicant has not been subject to adverse press or media attention of a nature that may have an adverse effect on College’s reputation; and • that views or information published on social media platforms are not of a nature that may have an adverse effect on College’s reputation. A decision not to progress an application will not be made solely on the basis of an apparent social media presence and any adverse findings will always be checked with the applicant before a decision is made. This forms part of our wider safeguarding due diligence which aims to prevent and/or deter individuals who may be unsuitable to work with children from working in a school environment. 4.7 Childcare disqualification requirements For staff who work in childcare provision or who are directly concerned with the management of such provision, College carry out appropriate checks to ensure that individuals are not disqualified under the Childcare (Disqualification) Regulations 2018. Further information on the staff to whom these regulations apply, the checks that should be carried out, and the recording of those checks can be found in Disqualification under the Childcare Act 2006 statutory guidance. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/disqualification-under-the-childcare-act-2006 Childcare provision is defined as: § Early Years Provision (EYP) which includes usual school activities and any other supervised activity for a child up to 1 September after the child’s 5th birthday, which takes place on the school premises during or outside of the normal school day; § Later Years Provision (LYP) which includes provision for children not in EYP and under the age of 8, which takes place on school premises outside of the normal school day, including, for example breakfast clubs, after school clubs and holiday clubs. It does not include extended school hours for co-curricular activities such as sports activities. Only those individuals who are employed directly to provide childcare are covered by the Regulations. “Childcare” means any form of care for a child, which includes education and any other supervised activity for a child who is aged 5 or under. “Childcare” in LYP does not include education during school hours but does cover before and after school clubs. Roles which will be covered by the Regulations are teaching and teaching assistant positions in EYP, and those which involve the supervision of under 8s in LYP. Those who are directly involved in the management of EYP and LYP include the Head, and may also include other members of the leadership team as well as those involved in the day to day management of EYP or LYP at the School. Cleaners, drivers, transport escorts, catering and office staff are not covered by the Regulations. Some roles at College may involve the provision of childcare in EYP or LYP on an occasional basis. They will not automatically be within the scope of the Regulations and College will therefore consider whether they do on a case- by-case basis. The Regulations only apply to a limited number of roles within College but do extend beyond employees to governors and 11 volunteers who carry out relevant work in EYP or LYP. Under the legislation a person is disqualified if they are found to have committed an offence which is included in the 2018 regulations (a ‘relevant offence’) this includes: § being convicted of a"}

The Regulations only apply to a limited number of roles within College but do extend beyond employees to governors and 11 volunteers who carry out relevant work in EYP or LYP. Under the legislation a person is disqualified if they are found to have committed an offence which is included in the 2018 regulations (a ‘relevant offence’) this includes: § being convicted of a relevant offence § on or after 6 April 2007, being given a caution for a relevant offence § on or after 8 April 2013, being given a youth caution for a relevant offence Please refer to the statutory guidance page noted above for further details. All applicants to whom an offer of employment is made to carry out a relevant role in EYP or LYP will be required to complete a Self-Declaration Form confirming whether they meet any of the criteria for disqualification under the Regulations. Employment in any relevant role will be conditional upon completion of the Self-Declaration Form and upon the applicant not being disqualified. College also reserves the right at its absolute discretion to withdraw an offer of employment if, in the opinion of College, any information disclosed in the Self-Declaration Form renders that person unsuitable to work at the school. Applicants who have any criminal records information to disclose about themselves, must also provide the following information: § Details of the order, restriction, conviction or caution and the date that this was made; § The relevant court or body and the sentence, if any, which was imposed; and § A copy of the relevant order or conviction. The process for assessing the disclosure of a conviction or a DBS certificate which shows a conviction is as follows: • the individual will be invited to a meeting with the Bursar to discuss the conviction and any mitigating factors including the length of time since the incident and the nature of the offence • the Bursar will make a recommendation to the President of Council as to whether the DBS may be acceptable to College • The President of Council will fully consider the matter and will email the conclusion to the Bursar and the Director of HR and Payroll • if the mitigation is not acceptable to College then the offer of employment will be withdrawn, and this will be confirmed in writing • if the DBS is acceptable to the President of Council, then the DBS status will be recorded as ‘Council Approved’ and the email added to the personnel file • the decision of the President of Council is final A person who discloses information, which appears to disqualify them from working in a relevant role, may apply to Ofsted for a waiver of the disqualification. College may withdraw an offer of employment at its absolute discretion and is under no obligation to await the outcome of an Ofsted waiver application. If a waiver application is rejected College will withdraw the conditional offer of employment. College will securely destroy any information provided by an applicant, which is not relevant to the childcare disqualification requirements as soon as it is established that it is not relevant. Where a person appointed to a role at College is found to be disqualified, College will retain any relevant information only for the period it takes for a waiver application to be heard and the decision communicated to College, after which it will be securely destroyed. After making this declaration staff in a relevant role are under an on-going duty to inform College if their circumstances change in a way that would mean they subsequently meet any of the criteria for disqualification. Any failure to disclose relevant information now, or of a future 12 change in circumstances, will be treated as a serious disciplinary matter and may lead to the withdrawal of a job offer or dismissal for gross misconduct. Staff will be asked to reaffirm their Self-Declaration as suitable to work at College under these guidelines from time to"}

Staff will be asked to reaffirm their Self-Declaration as suitable to work at College under these guidelines from time to time. 4.8 TRA Teacher Employer Access service College will use the TRA’s Employer Access service to make prohibition, direction, restriction and children’s barred list checks. These checks will be carried out for roles which are responsible to teaching including Sports Professionals. 5. Contractors and Agency Staff Contractors engaged by College must complete the same checks for their employees that College is required to complete for its staff. College requires confirmation that these checks have been completed before employees of the Contractor can commence work at College. Agencies who supply staff to College must also complete the pre- employment checks which College would otherwise complete for its staff. Again, College requires confirmation that these checks have been completed before an individual can commence work at College. College will independently verify the identity of staff supplied by contractors or an agency. In the case of agency workers College will require the provision of the original DBS disclosure certificate before agency staff can commence work at College. Unchecked contractors and agency staff will not, under any circumstances, be allowed to work unsupervised. 6. Volunteers College will request an enhanced DBS disclosure and Children’s Barred List information, or undertake a check online where the applicant has subscribed to the Update Service, on all volunteers undertaking regulated activity with pupils at or on behalf of College (the definition of regulated activity set out above will be applied to all volunteers). College may request an enhanced DBS disclosure without Children’s Barred List information on all volunteers who do not undertake regulated activity. This is likely to be because their volunteering duties are subject to regular, day to day supervision by a fully checked member of staff or by a volunteer who College has deemed appropriate to supervise and ensure the safety of those pupils in their care. Under no circumstances will College permit an unchecked volunteer to have unsupervised contact with pupils. It is College policy that a new DBS certificate may be required for volunteers who will engage in regulated activity but who have not been involved in any activities with College for three consecutive months or more. Those volunteers who are likely to be involved in activities at College on a regular basis may be required to sign up to the DBS update service as this permits College to obtain up to date criminal records information without delay prior to each new activity in which a volunteer participates. In addition, College will seek to obtain such further suitability information about a volunteer as it considers appropriate in the circumstances. This may include (but is not limited to the following): 13 • Formal or informal information provided by staff, parents and other volunteers; • Character references from the volunteer’s place of work or any other relevant source; and • An informal safer recruitment interview. Where host families are arranged by College then members of the host family who are over 16 years of age will be required to obtain a DBS certificate which is satisfactory to College. Staff should ensure that they consult the relevant sections of KCSIE well in advance of making any host arrangements. 7. Appointment of Governors (Council) Members of the Board of Governors (the Council) are trustees of a registered charity (Cheltenham College and Cheltenham College Preparatory school – 311720) and carry responsibility for the selection and appointment of new Council members. This is a legal responsibility that cannot be delegated. Council members are aware of the importance of creating the right mix of skills and experience on the board to ensure balanced and effective governance of the affairs of Cheltenham"}

Appointment of Governors (Council) Members of the Board of Governors (the Council) are trustees of a registered charity (Cheltenham College and Cheltenham College Preparatory school – 311720) and carry responsibility for the selection and appointment of new Council members. This is a legal responsibility that cannot be delegated. Council members are aware of the importance of creating the right mix of skills and experience on the board to ensure balanced and effective governance of the affairs of Cheltenham College. Delivering the right mix is the core purpose of the Council Membership and Governance Committee. Potential Council members (who may be identified, or who may put themselves forward) will be expected to undergo a rigorous selection process that will involve an initial meeting with the Secretary to Council, followed by further meetings and/or interviews with the Chair of the Nominations Committee, The President of Council, the Head, the Head of the Preparatory School, the Bursar – and possibly other members of Council and/or senior staff members. As well as ensuring suitability and ‘fit’ the selection process aims to ensure that prospective Council members have a clear understanding of the commitment expected of them, in terms of time and attendance. During the process prospective members are also provided with sufficient information, written and verbal, to allow a well-informed judgement to be made before committing themselves to an appointment. All potential new appointments to the Council are first considered at a meeting of the Membership and Governance Committee. If supported by the Membership and Governance Committee, a formal recommendation is then made to a meeting of the full Council, which must formally ratify all new appointments. All such appointments are formally recorded in the Council Minutes and a letter of appointment is subsequently sent by the Secretary to the appointee, on behalf of the President. Before each new appointment is confirmed, safer recruitment checks are completed: • An enhanced disclosure from the DBS • A barred list check if regulated activity will be undertaken • Evidence of entitlement to work in the UK • Confirmation that the prospective Council member is not disqualified from acting as a Charity Trustee or Company Director • Evidence that the prospective Council member has not been prohibited from participating in the management of independent schools • Overseas checks where the prospective member has lived outside the UK for a continuous period of more than 3-months in the 10 years prior to their appointment If the President (Chair) of Council is to change, College will ensure that the DfE obtains an enhanced criminal records check, and checks both the identity, and the right to work in the UK, of the proposed new President before he or she takes up the post. These checks will be made 14 regardless of whether the new President is already serving as a Council member or is a new appointee. 8. Internal Appointments When applicants for any position are current members of staff, internal references must be sought. Where the new position is in the form of an additional responsibility, then the necessity to take up internal references will be at the discretion of the Senior Leadership Team having regard to relevant regulatory advice. If staff move from a non-teaching to a teaching role, or an unregulated to a regulated role, then checks relevant to the new role, such as prohibition from teaching checks, will be carried out where they were not completed at the time of original appointment. Where the new role involves taking part in the management of College (as detailed above) then a check will be carried out under section 128 of the Independent Educational Provision in England (Prohibition on Participation in Management) Regulations 2014. Appointment to the new role is subject to these checks being satisfactory to College. Any staff who TUPE transfer into the Colleges staff will be required to undertake the statutory requirements with regard to safer recruitment checks. If staff are transferred under TUPE ( with a service gap of three months or less and with pre-employment check information complete) information will be passed"}

Any staff who TUPE transfer into the Colleges staff will be required to undertake the statutory requirements with regard to safer recruitment checks. If staff are transferred under TUPE ( with a service gap of three months or less and with pre-employment check information complete) information will be passed to the new employer and a note made on the Single Central Record that details have been accepted under TUPE. 9. Visiting speakers and the Prevent Duty The Prevent Duty Guidance requires College to have clear protocols for ensuring that any visiting speakers, whether invited by staff or by pupils, are suitable and appropriately supervised. College is not permitted to obtain a DBS disclosure or Children’s Barred List information on any visiting speaker who does not engage in regulated activity at College or perform any other regular duties for or on behalf of College. All visiting speakers will be subject to College’s usual visitors’ protocol. This will include signing in and out at Reception, the wearing of a visitor’s badge at all times and being escorted by a fully vetted member of staff between appointments. College will also obtain such formal or informal background information about a visiting speaker as is reasonable in the circumstances to decide whether to invite and/or permit a speaker to attend College. In doing so College will always have regard to the Visitors and Security Policy, the Prevent Duty Guidance and other relevant legislation and guidance. In fulfilling its Prevent Duty obligations College does not discriminate on the grounds of race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, religion or religious belief, sex or sexual orientation, marital or civil partner status, disability or age. 10. Policy on recruitment of ex-offenders 10.1 Background Shortlisted candidates will be asked to complete a self-declaration form in regard to their criminal record and/or other information relating to their suitability to work with children. Self-declaration is subject to Ministry of Justice guidance on the disclosure of criminal records, 15 further information can be found on GOV.UK College will not unfairly discriminate against any applicant for employment on the basis of conviction or other details disclosed. College makes appointment decisions on the basis of merit and ability. If an applicant has a criminal record this will not automatically bar them from employment with College. Each case will be decided on its merits in accordance with the objective assessment criteria set out in below. All positions within College are exempt from the provisions of the prevailing Rehabilitation of Offenders legislation. All applicants must therefore declare all previous convictions and cautions, including those which would normally be considered “spent” except those received for an offence committed in the United Kingdom if it has been filtered in accordance with the DBS filtering rules. Applicants are not required to disclose a caution or conviction for an offence committed in the United Kingdom if it has been filtered in accordance with the DBS filtering rules (see DBS Filtering Guidance at Gov.uk for full details). https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-filtering-guidance/dbs-filtering-guide A failure to disclose a previous conviction (which should be declared) may lead to an application being rejected or, if the failure to disclose is discovered after employment has started, may lead to summary dismissal on the grounds of gross misconduct. A failure to disclose a previous conviction may also amount to a criminal offence. It is unlawful for College to employ anyone who is barred from working with children. It is a criminal offence for any person who is barred from working with children to apply for a position at the school. College will make a report to the Police and / or the DBS if: § It receives an application from a barred person; § It is provided with false information in, or in support of an applicant’s application; or § It has serious concerns about an applicant’s suitability to work with children. In addition, it will also be unlawful"}

It is a criminal offence for any person who is barred from working with children to apply for a position at the school. College will make a report to the Police and / or the DBS if: § It receives an application from a barred person; § It is provided with false information in, or in support of an applicant’s application; or § It has serious concerns about an applicant’s suitability to work with children. In addition, it will also be unlawful for the College to employ anyone who is the subject of a disqualifying order made on being convicted or charged with the following offences against children: murder, manslaughter, rape, other serious sexual offences, grievous bodily harm or other serious acts of violence. It is also unlawful for the School to knowingly employ someone who works in the relevant settings and is disqualified from providing childcare under the statutory guidance “Disqualification under the Childcare Act 2006”. 10.2 Assessment criteria In the event that relevant information (whether in relation to previous convictions or otherwise) is volunteered by an applicant during the recruitment process or obtained through a disclosure check, College will consider the following factors before reaching a recruitment decision: § Whether the conviction or other matter revealed is relevant to the position in question; § The seriousness of any offence or other matter revealed; § Whether the conviction or caution is 'protected' as defined by the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exceptions) Order 1975 (Amendment) (England and Wales) Order 2020 (if yes, it will not be taken into account); § The length of time since the offence or other matter occurred; § Whether the applicant has a pattern of offending behaviour or other relevant matters; § Whether the applicant's circumstances have changed since the offending behaviour or 16 other relevant matters; and § The circumstances surrounding the offence and the explanation(s) offered by the applicant. If the post involves regular contact with children, it is College’s normal policy to consider it a high risk to employ anyone who has been convicted at any time of any the following offences: § Murder, manslaughter, rape, other serious sexual offences, grievous bodily harm or other serious acts of violence; or § Serious class A drug related offences, robbery, burglary, theft, deception or fraud. If the post involves access to money or budget responsibility, it is College's normal policy to consider it a high risk to employ anyone who has been convicted at any time of robbery, burglary, theft, deception or fraud. If the post involves some driving responsibilities, it is College’s normal policy to consider it a high risk to employ anyone who has been convicted of drink driving. In all such circumstances College will carry out a risk assessment by reference to the criteria set out above. The assessment must be signed or confirmed through email by the Bursar, the Head of College and the President of Council before a position is offered or confirmed. If an applicant wishes to dispute any information contained in a disclosure, they may do so by contacting the DBS. In cases where the applicant would otherwise be offered a position were it not for the disputed information, College may, where practicable and at its discretion, defer a final decision about the appointment until the applicant has had a reasonable opportunity to challenge the disclosure information. 11. Retention of Records and security of disclosure information College is legally required to undertake the pre-appointment checks described in this Policy. Therefore, if an applicant is successful in their application, College will retain on their personnel file any relevant information provided as part of the application process. This will include copies of documents used to verify identity, right to work in the UK, medical fitness for work and qualifications. All information will be stored and retained in accordance with College’s Data Protection Policy and the Privacy Notice for Staff during and, for the period described in these policies, after employment. College policy is to observe the guidance issued or supported by the DBS on the use of disclosure information. In particular,"}

College policy is to observe the guidance issued or supported by the DBS on the use of disclosure information. In particular, the College will: § Store disclosure information and other confidential documents issued by the DBS in locked, non-portable storage containers, access to which will be restricted to members of the College’s Leadership Team; § Not retain disclosure information or any associated correspondence for longer than is necessary, and for a maximum of six months. College will keep a record of the date of a disclosure, the name of the subject, the type of disclosure, the position in question, the unique number issued by the DBS and the recruitment decision taken; § Ensure that any disclosure information is destroyed by suitably secure means such as shredding; and § Prohibit the photocopying or scanning of any disclosure information without the express permission of the individual to whom the disclosure relates. Fitness for work information may be used to help College to discharge its obligations as an 17 employer e.g. so that College may consider reasonable adjustments if an employee suffers from a health condition, disability or to assist with any other workplace issue. This documentation will be retained by College for the duration of the successful applicant's employment. If the application is unsuccessful, all documentation relating to the application will normally be confidentially destroyed after six months. The same policy applies to any suitability information obtained about volunteers involved with College activities. 12. Referrals to the DBS and Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) This policy is primarily concerned with the promotion of safer recruitment and details the pre-employment checks that will be undertaken prior to employment being confirmed. Whilst these are pre-employment checks College also has a legal duty to make a referral to the DBS in circumstances where an individual: - § Has applied for a position at College despite being barred from working with children; or § Has been removed by College from working in regulated activity (whether paid or unpaid), or has resigned prior to being removed, because they have harmed or pose a risk of harm, to a child, If a teacher is referred to the DBS, College may also decide to make a referral to the Teacher Regulation Agency (TRA)."}

April 2024 Report This report is based on 581 relevant full pay employees of which 207 (35.6 %) are men and 374 (64.4 %) are women. Hourly Pay Mean gender pay gap: 15.4 % (ie on average our female employees are paid 15.4 % less per hour than our male employees) Median Pay Gap: 25.2 % (there is a difference of 25.2 % between the mid-points of the distributions of male pay and female pay) Pay Quartiles: Male Female Top Quartile: 47.6 % 52.4 % Upper Middle Quartile: 39.7 % 60.3 % Lower Middle Quartile: 26.9 % 73.1 % Lower Quartile: 28.3 % 71.7 % Cheltenham College is committed to providing a good working environment for all our staff and that includes ensuring staff receive a fair rate of pay for the work which they do. We review our salaries on an annual basis and regularly benchmark pay for our support staff. We aim to ensure that pay is set according to the complexity of the work being undertaken, regardless of gender, and we believe that our hourly pay gender pay gap reflects the nature of our workforce. 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Mean Gap 13.9 % 9.9 % 17.2 % 18.2% 18.5% 15.4% Median Gap 23.8 % 9.0 % 27.0 % 27.8% 29.1% 25.2% The 2020 figures above reflect the exclusion through furlough of a large number of our Housekeeping staff. The Housekeeping team is now bigger than pre-pandemic levels. The Mean Gender Pay Gap for our teaching staff is 5.0%. The Median Gender Pay Gap for our Support staff is 15.1% but drops to 7.6% if Housekeeping are removed. This reflects the fact that we have a larger number of female staff on the Housekeeping Team which attracts lower pay and draws down the Median pay figure for women overall. Whilst we have an equivalent role in Estates which attracts the same pay rate but is predominately male, the size of the Estates Team is much smaller than Housekeeping.

(i) COVID-19 & NHS TEST AND TRACE College has a duty of care to our staff and our pupils. As more pupils are returning to our schools, the safety and wellbeing of all who study or work here, and their families is a priority. Our Health Centre is bound by the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2019, which requires registered medical practitioners to report notifiable diseases, including Coronavirus (COVID-19). If a person in our schools has COVID-19 or symptoms of the virus then we will follow our policies and procedures to prevent transmission throughout our community. In a school setting, it would be most unusual for any one person to know the details of everyone else who 9 may be affected. It is only the school that will have that data. We would notify individuals about a risk, and in many instances that would be sufficient. As a school we will cooperate with requests for information from Public Health England or the NHS. Although at no point will we share data without a sound legal basis, please be aware that we will share data where necessary and it is likely that we will be asked to provide contact details if a case or suspected case of coronavirus (or other outbreak) arises in our schools. Data (e.g. name, contact details, attendance information, etc.) will be shared on the basis that it is in our “legitimate interest”. This basis recognises that sharing data is likely to be in the interests of the individual, the organisation, and public health. Where it is necessary to share special category data (including relevant medical information) College will rely on the basis that to do so it “necessary for reasons of public interest” in the area of public health, such as protection against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of high standards of quality and safety of health care (Article 9(2)(i)). Please be assured that we will keep a record of information that we share. HOW LONG WE KEEP PERSONAL DATA Cheltenham College will retain personal data securely and only in line with how long it is necessary to keep for a legitimate and lawful reason. Personal data relating to unsuccessful job applicants is deleted 9 months after the successful appoint is made, except where we have notified you that we intend to keep it for longer (and you have not objected). Subject to any other notices that we may provide to you, we may retain your personal data for a period of 7 years after your contract has expired or been terminated. However, incident reports and safeguarding files will need to be kept much longer, in accordance with specific legal requirements. Moreover, Cheltenham College may retain some personal data relating to members of staff for archiving purposes (including historical research) in order to preserve and commemorate Cheltenham College’s community and heritage. Records held for archive purposes are held subject to strict closure periods as required by Data Protection Law, as detailed within the Archive & Heritage Collections Policy. If you have any specific queries about how this policy is applied or wish to request that personal data that you no longer believe to be relevant is considered for erasure, please contact the"}

If you have any specific queries about how this policy is applied or wish to request that personal data that you no longer believe to be relevant is considered for erasure, please contact the Data Protection Manager. However, please bear in mind that Cheltenham College may have lawful and necessary reasons to hold on to some data. KEEPING IN TOUCH AND SUPPORTING CHELTENHAM COLLEGE In addition to compliance with current Data Protection legislation, Cheltenham College and the Cheltonian Society operates in line with the Privacy and Electronic Communications (2003) Act and will request explicit consent in order to maintain relationships with alumni and Cheltenham College community, including direct marketing and fundraising activity. (i) CHELTONIAN SOCIETY 10 The Cheltonian Society may request the consent of alumni, parents, staff and other members of College’s community to use their contact details to keep them updated about Cheltenham College activities, or events of interest, including sending updates and newsletters by email and by post. (ii) DEVELOPMENT Cheltenham College may contact individuals who consent to keep them updated about Cheltenham College activities, or events of interest. In addition, Cheltenham College may contact individuals who consent, including members of the 1841 Society and the Hugh Reeves Legacy Society, with information regarding opportunities to raise funds and support the development of Cheltenham College and, where appropriate, other worthy causes actively supported by current pupils. Cheltenham College may collect information from publicly available sources about an individual’s occupations and activities, in order to maximise Cheltenham College’s fundraising potential and conduct donor due diligence. Individuals may be grouped with similar people who may be able to give at a particular level or who have similar interests. This practice reduces the likelihood that individuals will be contacted about projects to which they cannot or do not wish to support. YOUR RIGHTS Individuals have various rights under Data Protection Law to access and understand personal data about them held by Cheltenham College, and in some cases ask for it to be erased or amended or for College to stop processing it, but subject to certain exemptions and limitations. Any individual wishing to access or amend their personal data or wishing it to be transferred to another person or organisation, or who has some other objection to how their personal data is used, should put their request in writing to the Data Protection Manager. Cheltenham College will endeavour to respond to any such written requests as soon as is reasonably practicable and in any event within statutory time-limits, which is one month in the case of requests for access to information. Cheltenham College will be better able to respond quickly to smaller, targeted requests for information. If the request is manifestly excessive or similar to previous requests, Cheltenham College may ask you to reconsider or charge a proportionate fee, but only where Data Protection Law allows it. You should be aware that certain data is exempt from the right of access. This may include information which identifies other individuals, or information which is subject to legal professional privilege. Cheltenham College is also not required to disclose any pupil examination scripts (though examiners' comments may fall to be disclosed), nor any confidential reference given by Cheltenham College for the purposes of the education, training or employment of any individual. CONSENT Where Cheltenham College is relying on consent as a means to process personal data, any person may withdraw this consent at any time. Please be aware however that Cheltenham College may have another lawful reason to process the personal data in question even without your consent. 11 That reason will usually have been asserted under this Privacy Notice or may otherwise exist under some form of contract or agreement with the individual.

At Cheltenham College social media checks will be conducted on candidates to whom a conditional offer has been made and will be carried out by the HR Department. Checks will be carried out using generally available search engines and the candidate’s name (or names where appropriate) and relevant key words such as ‘teacher’ or ‘school’ or places of study or employment such as ‘University of Gloucestershire’. Where a check does not produce adverse results, then a record of the date the check was completed and the name of the person undertaking the check will be kept. No detailed information or images will be downloaded or stored as part of a candidate’s file. Should a social media search produce results which may prove of potential concern to College, then these will be shared with the Bursar or relevant Head and discussed with the candidate to allow the candidate to explain and provide context before any decision is taken. Decisions in regard to adverse social media profiles will only be taken by the relevant school Head or by the Bursar. The candidate will be informed of the outcome of that decision in writing and the letter to the candidate will form the only record which is retained as part of their personnel file. Files on unsuccessful candidates are retained for a period of up to 12 months after the final interview date and then destroyed. July 2023"}

It is at the centre of College life, and pupils attend Chapel several times a week. It is also an environment that supports the wellbeing of pupils by providing a peaceful place for reflection and contemplation. Chapel is a magnificent and iconic piece of architecture that located centrally within the College grounds, and was designed by former pupil Henry Prothero to celebrate College’s 50th anniversary and dedicated in 1896. Whilst services follow the practices of the Church of England and are led by Anglican clergy, deep respect for other faiths is cultivated at College. The purpose of morning chapel is the development of the values of justice, peace, love, compassion, forgiveness and integrity. We follow a thematic syllabus which corresponds, in many ways, to the Church calendar but which also facilitates broader reflection and teaching. The chapel talks are given by pupils, members of staff or the chaplains. Public events, including Choral Evensong and organ recitals by internationally renowned performers, are held in Chapel throughout the year. Upcoming Recitals Tuesday 5 November, 1.15pm to 2.00pm. James Drinkwater, Clifton College. Music by Granados and Martin. Tuesday 3 December, 1.15pm to 2.00pm. James Lancelot, Canon organist Emeritus, Durham Cathedral. Music by J.S. Bach and Dupré. The Senior Chaplain is the Reverend Dr Adam Dunning. He joined College from parish ministry and is assisted by the Reverend Dr Adrian Samuel and his wife the Reverend Dr Kerry Samuel. Dr Dunning read Philosophy and Theology at Oxford University and after completing a Ph.D at the University of Birmingham trained for the priesthood at Cambridge University. He is also the College Director of Community, Charity and Partnerships. College services and recitals are regularly streamed online. Upcoming and past streams can be viewed on the Cheltenham College Chapel Youtube channel here.

Our pupils are involved in all aspects of our community activities, helping to nurture an instinctive spirit of philanthropy and foster a strong sense of the importance of community within them. Their involvement raises their awareness of real-life issues locally, nationally and internationally. It also provides experiences that are invaluable during applications to Higher Education and entry into the world of work.

As well as College-wide initiatives, each House chooses a charity to support each year, as does the Prefect body. We encourage our pupils to generate their own ideas to support their chosen charities and to deliver projects and events themselves. In this way, pupils have raised funds for good causes in the past year through events as varied as a whole school walk and a comedy night. In the past year, Cheltenham College raised over £58,000 for various charities, with over £31,000 going to the Prefects’ chosen charity Teenage Cancer Trust.

Community Action and Charity COMMUNITY ACTION AND CHARITY Cheltenham College CC162 Change brochure AW.indd 1 19/09/2019 15:44 2 Community Action and Charity FOREWORD Commitment to the service of others and a readiness to contribute to the common good, with respect for people and the environment, is one of the long standing aims of Cheltenham College. Our School has had a historic tradition of service to the community in its widest sense, and this booklet details the many different ways that our staff, pupils, parents and friends have come together to support local charities and projects in the last few years. The projects listed here are numerous but the really interesting fact about our involvement with them as a School is that we seek to build deep, sincere and lasting relationships with them. We hope to get to know them well, and they us. We have enjoyed raising money and awareness, but even more importantly, we have all been inspired to really engage with the individuals who give their time and energy so generously, and also those who benefit from it in so many different ways. It has been my pleasure and privilege to hear from our young people on a regular basis that their community work and volunteering has changed the way they approach their lives from this point on. Our relationships with these charities and community projects have developed through the involvement of many generations of Cheltonians, and we look forward to continuing these long-lasting and fulfilling partnerships for many years yet to come. Nicola Huggett, Head of Cheltenham College CC162 Change brochure AW.indd 2 19/09/2019 15:44 3 Community Action and Charity Part One: Community Action CC162 Change brochure AW.indd 3 19/09/2019 15:44 4 Community Action and CharityCOMMUNITY ACTION – OUR PHILOSOPHY Taking an active role in our local community is a well-established part of life at Cheltenham College. One of the ways we achieve this is through our Community Action Programme. Its principal focus is to cultivate a spirit of service in all our pupils. What is the Community Action Programme? Every week 150 of our pupils go out into the community and volunteer in a wide variety of placements. These include: schools, elder care, community groups, people with special needs, our local hospital, the park and other independent organisations. The core aims of the Community Action Programme • T o nurture the habit of giving – of time, talent, resources and energy. • T o encourage respect for difference and diversity. • T o broaden our pupils’ perspective of society. • T o provide our pupils with experiences which will support their applications to Higher Education and the world of work.

They also coach sports sessions in after-school clubs, from rugby and netball to fitness circuits. I look forward to my time at All Saint’s Academy , where I help Year 7 pupils in Science and Maths. Dealing with a wide range of abilities has made my experience very rewarding, especially during slightly chaotic practical lessons! The pupils benefit from having more one-on-one contact, especially with people closer to their age. Charlotte, Year 12 Students have made a real impact providing extra support and guidance to our young people across a range of subjects which is reflected in both the development of student confidence and assessment scores. Mr L Kelly, Partnership Co-ordinator, All Saints’ Academy Children at Oakwood have developed friendly and productive relationships with College pupils, and see them as positive role models. Staff have also benefitted from well-motivated and enthusiastic classroom support. Socially our children have truly gained from working with students from a different demographic. Dave Hill, Operational Head, Oakwood I have been very impressed with the leadership qualities the students have demonstrated at All Saints’ Academy. Our Year 7 rugby team especially have benefitted from their sporting expertise, making outstanding progress, along with developing their social skills and Christian values.

These settings are diverse and challenging, but also very rewarding. Our students’ levels of confidence grow and they learn to develop inclusive and constructive attitudes towards disability. It has been wonderful for our children to have students from College helping in the classrooms. It has provided the opportunity to make friends and accept help from peers, rather than be dependent on adult staff to support them. The students from College have gained a valuable insight into disability and how our pupils do not let their problems stop them from enjoying life to the full. Lyn Dance, Headteacher, The Milestone School At Milestones it has been such a privilege for me to work alongside the teachers and carers who support children with complex special needs. No day is the same but every day is rewarding, especially when you see you have made a difference. Emily, Year 12 It has been a really rewarding time at Battledown , helping nursery-aged children with learning difficulties. I go into the soft play area and encourage them to play in ball pits, down slides and on a trampoline. A highlight was seeing a boy, who was too scared to go down the slide to begin with, get closer and closer each week, until he finally went down!” Molly, Year 12 It is a fantastic opportunity for our pupils to spend time with the students from College on a regular basis. We are able to offer valuable 1-to-1 sessions in movement, cooking and art activities. It is an amazing way of sharing good practice, building awareness of special educational needs and linking with the community.

Each setting is unique and offers scope for students to increase their awareness of ‘real-life’ issues and initiatives. I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to work as a ‘befriender’ at Cheltenham Hospital . I have helped by making beds, restocking supply cupboards and assisting at meal times. As an aspiring doctor, the experience has definitely been valuable, teaching me skills in listening and speaking to patients. Flo, Year 12 We love our weekly visits to the Wilson Galleries because they are always so varied and interesting. Our social media work has been especially rewarding. We also invigilate in the galleries, where we get to meet visitors and help with information. Charlie, Year 12 Students from College have gained a valuable insight into the running of busy surgical and medical wards. They have shadowed ward rounds, working with physiotherapists and occupational therapists. They have also offered the role of wayfinding for our visitors. It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to work with the College and gain the mutual benefits of this partnership. Sarah Brown, Volunteer Manager Cheltenham Hospital The Rock is a safe place where 10-16 year olds go to, where they learn new skills and play sports. I work with the high energy group which can be challenging, but is also incredibly rewarding. Volunteering at the Rock is an amazing privilege, and it is a true highlight of my week. Stephanie, Year 12 The College students have been a great asset, supporting our team in running activities at The Rock’s TNT youth group; getting involved, encouraging other young people in arts & crafts and cooking activities and developing their own skills. Ali English, Community Champion, The Rock Our pupils have worked with: Cheltenham General Hospital The Rock The Wilson Art Gallery and Museum CC162 Change brochure AW.indd 8 19/09/2019 15:44 9 Community Action and CharityWORKING WITH THE ELDERLY We make weekly visits to care homes in and around Cheltenham. All sorts of activities take place, including sharing conversation, playing card games, light gardening and bingo (a real favourite!) All of these have encouraged trusting friendships enjoyed by everyone. Students gain a valuable insight into life for the elderly, and residents enjoy the energy and variety that young people bring with them. Many of the people we visit at Thirlestaine Park care home have neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s. Although this can be challenging at times, they are always very happy whilst we are there. This makes the experience extremely rewarding as we can see that our visit means so much to them. Lamar, Year 12 At Windsor Street my friends and I spend many happy hours chatting with the residents. The time goes very quickly with the seemingly unlimited number of intriguing stories that are produced! One of my favourite activities is the musical sessions because singing (and occasionally dancing) with the nurses and residents is great fun. This experience has taught me patience with people as some residents have dementia. Archie, Year 12 College students have definitely helped make a positive difference to residents’ lives. Through conversation they encourage them to share memories and express themselves. Many of our elderly look forward to the College weekly visit, and their upbeat and enthusiastic attitudes, which radiates to others.

We believe it is never too early to encourage a sense of community in our younger pupils. Each term they face a new challenge in a different setting. In each they gain first-hand experience of the daily realities people face and a broader understanding of local community needs. Hop Skip and Jump provides respite care for children and young adults with disabilities and special educational needs. Our pupils engage in conversation with their HSJ peers, encouraging manners and helping the children to practice feeding themselves. The benefit to College pupils is huge: they get to see what life is like for children of their own ages who face challenges in grappling with everyday tasks. Jo Doidge-Harrison, Cheltenham College One of the highlights of my time at Faithfull House care home was the small concert we put on for the residents. It was amazing to see the residents joining in with singing and dancing and for a lot of them it brought back childhood memories. Sophie, Year 10 In my experience, intergenerational visits are very beneficial for both residents and students. They have been positive sessions and we have had enjoyable afternoons sharing experiences. Joana Matias, Activities Co-ordinator, Faithfull House Hop Skip and Jump is a very special place because it’s full of laughter, even though some of the children have a lot of personal challenges. It was a real eye-opener to me, to see just how difficult everyday tasks, which I take for granted, can be for the children. Nathalie, Year 10 I visit Naunton Park Primary School during story times for Years 2-5, where we use the ‘Story Massage’ technique. While the children are read to we do ‘massage’ actions to complement the story. This helps them focus better and it aids concentration. Honor, Year 10 Sarah Checketts (College staff member) and her team provide great role models for the young pupils, and they are eagerly awaited each Wednesday. We really appreciate their efforts.

Sports leaders plan and deliver weekly sessions in three of our partner schools. Sports Leadership Level 1 The award focuses on delivering sport and physical activity sessions to younger people. It also develops and hones leadership skills. ‘Go Lead’ Offers an introduction to leadership and the skills needed to lead basic activity sessions under direct supervision. Young leaders from Cheltenham College have been planning and delivering football and cricket sessions to our Year 5 pupils since Autumn 2018. They have a positive manner with everyone, which creates a fantastic learning environment. Hope Sanders, St John’s Primary School Sport Leadership has given our pupils the opportunity to teach and coach younger pupils in a realistic situation, a task which for some has been quite challenging. Kate Hornsby, Sports Science, Cheltenham College CC162 Change brochure AW.indd 11 19/09/2019 15:45 12 Community Action and CharityCOMMUNITY SERVICE DAYS As part of our Community Action Programme Year 10 pupils also participate in ‘Service Days’. These projects are ambitious and have an immediate impact on improving areas in our local community. Rising to a challenge with the Canal and River Trust More than twenty pupils worked to clean up a stretch of the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal.

The bridge and the stairs were in a state when we got there and now they are looking cleaner and almost brand new. The whole day was incredibly satisfying and rewarding. and we all worked as a team and just got the job done. Freya, Year 10Making a difference in the gardens of Cheltenham General Hospital Pupils spent a whole day in the grounds of Cheltenham Hospital , with a focus on improving a ‘neglected’ area of courtyard garden. Their challenge was to clear overgrown areas for re-planting and lay a new path, creating a place of relaxation for hospital staff. Pupils showed true team spirit in clearing ivy, pruning roses and creating a flower bed. The pupils also worked hard to create new borders around the seating, lifting turf and laying gravel to improve the path network. We are all delighted with the improvements College pupils have made.” Cheltenham General Hospital This experience was a really good opportunity to give back to the community, esp ecially knowing it will be enjoyed by many others for years to come. Fin, Year 10 CC162 Change brochure AW.indd 12 19/09/2019 15:45 13 Community Action and CharityA day in the life of Cotswold Riding for the Disabled (RDA) A group of pupils and teachers set out to help the RDA and its visitors in as many ways as possible. Including: • c leaning tack • c leaning and painting horseshoes • d evising a treasure hunt for the ‘Day for the Deaf’ • d igging the track for the outdoor arena • g rooms talk on RDA horse selection and animal behaviour • w atching and learning from lessons Each task the groups did for us was very much needed and appreciated. Everyone worked so hard for the benefit of all our riders. The pupils enjoyed learning about all the different activities RDA offers, and how they help our visitors. Claire Jenkins, General Manager, RDA It was fascinating to learn about the amount of training the horses go through, in order to cope with a disabled rider on their back. These horses have to be able to handle any situation and deal with anything the riders may do. We could all see what a special place the RDA centre is. It was truly an amazing day and it was so wonderful to be a part of it. Sophie and Annie, Year 10 COMMUNITY ACTION FACTS AND FIGURES 150 pupils volunteer weekly as part of our Community Action Programme each year. 15 staff are involved in 28 community activities each year. 4,000 hours of volunteering in the community is completed each year by pupils. 800 hours of volunteering in the community is completed each year by staff.

We aim to: • R aise funds for charitable causes. • P rovide an opportunity for our pupils to gain first-hand experience of the challenges and issues which charities were established to address. • D evelop and deepen relationships with our charity partners. Our charitable work falls into three areas: House ‘adopted’ charities – Each House at College supports its own nominated charity in Cheltenham or Gloucestershire. House members fundraise for their charity and are practically involved. Guidance has been given by Gloucestershire’s Local Community Foundation in choosing local charities to support.Prefects’ charity – Each year the Prefects choose a charity that they connect with and then set about raising significant funds. Throughout the year whole College, group and individual fundraising initiatives are planned and organised by our pupils. Whole College initiatives focus on improving the prospects of disadvantaged areas of society. These projects build on a long-standing involvement and encourage collaborative participation, especially overseas. CC162 Change brochure AW.indd 15 19/09/2019 15:45 16 Community Action and CharityOUR HOUSE ‘ ADOPTED’ CHARITIES We aim to instil in our pupils the importance of caring about people who are less fortunate than themselves. Each of our 11 Houses is committed to supporting a local charity with which they can build a lasting partnership over successive years. While fundraising is a key focus, so too is being actively involved in the life of each charity. Each year pupils rise to the challenge of new and different ways to be involved with their charities. Events include: House BBQs, College drama productions, Comedy and Race evenings, sporting events, packing Christmas hampers, afternoon teas and many more. Ashmead House The Nelson Trust is a residential treatment centre providing a comprehensive programme of care and support for people looking for recovery from drug and alcohol addiction.Boyne House The James Hopkins Trust provides nursing respite care for Gloucestershire’s life limited and life threatened young children. Chandos House Gloucestershire Young Carers is a dynamic charity constantly growing and developing to meet the ever-changing needs of young carers in the county.

STAFF-LED 2 4 HOUR “INSOMNIA” ULTRA- MARATHON EVENT In August 2018 Beren Delbrooke-Jones and Richard Penny set themselves the challenge of tackling the 24-hour “insomnia” ultra-marathon event in Cotswold Park. What sounded like a far-fetched idea became a reality as we lined up for the start of the race, probably amongst only a handful of people who were cursing the summer heatwave. Our motivation was provided by the James Hopkins Trust. We are incredibly grateful for the generosity of all donors which allowed us to hand over a staggering £4,800 to the JHT.

Throughout the coming year Prefects and Year 13 pupils work together to plan and implement successful ways of fundraising and promoting awareness of the charity. The Chamwell Centre The Chamwell Centre Charity was a natural choice for the Prefects to support, alongside our well-established partnership with The Milestone School. It was a unanimous decision to contribute towards a major project primarily focused on improving the lives of Milestones pupils. Construction of the Chamwell Centre has now started, with the goal of building a state of the art therapy facility that will enable children, young people and adults throughout Gloucestershire to overcome disability. The centre will provide a large hydrotherapy pool with exciting therapy and sensory equipment, facilities for physical therapy, rebound therapy and soft play, as well as an all-ability play and sports area and a Community Café.The Prefects in action Throughout the year College Prefects showed dedication and initiative in leading a varied programme of high-profile charitable events. Rugby at Sixways Stadium Worcester The Sixways Stadium in Worcester hosted a Rugby match between the College X V and Radley College. This event encouraged huge support and through a host of imaginative fundraising activities, the Prefects raised nearly £2,500. Finn, Year 12 One million metre sponsored row Over 100 pupils, parents and staff, committed themselves to rowing a total distance of one million metres.

This was an occasion where the community spirit of College took on a life of its own in its shared purpose of supporting the Chamwell Centre. This venture on its own raised nearly £17,000. We are delighted that a strong bond has formed between the Milestone School with its Chamwell Centre Charity and Cheltenham College. The total of the Prefects’ fundraising for the Chamwell Centre will greatly enhance the lives of the Milestone children and many others like them in Gloucestershire. We are deeply grateful to the students for the many valuable ways in which they support our pupils. Dr Marie Owen, Chair of the Chamwell Centre CharityThe total of combined fund-raising was £24,000. A sea of College pupils set off on the 11km challenge. The atmosphere was electric, with everyone helping each other along the way, especially at the more difficult parts of the hill, thereby displaying the College spirit of kindness. However hard some of us found it, it was worth it when we got to Devil’s Chimney at the top of the hill with around 700 pupils enjoying a panoramic view of the whole of Cheltenham, taking photos and trying to spot different locations. It really was a sight to remember! After basking in the glorious view, everyone began to make their way back down the hill which was a breeze compared to the trek up! Overall it was a great way to display our community spirit by bringing the whole of College together whilst raising money for such a worthy cause. Anna, Year 13 CC162 Change brochure AW.indd 21 19/09/2019 15:45 22 Community Action and CharityTHE PREFECTS’ CHARITY 20 1 8- 20 1 9 Cheltenham College Prefects nominated The Teenage Cancer Trust (TCT) as their Charity of the Year, after their classmate Bella was diagnosed with non-H odgkin lymphoma in January 2018. The TCT is the only charity in the UK dedicated to improving the lives of young cancer patients aged 13 to 24. They build specialist units in NHS hospitals with dedicated staff, bringing young people together so they can be treated by teenage cancer experts in the very best of settings. A target with a special purpose Having witnessed the support and care offered to their classmate, the Prefects set themselves a £28,000 target. With it costing £1,000 per day to cover the costs of the charity, they called their campaign ‘Fund February’ Bella flies high Having completed a full course of chemotherapy, and in recognition of all the medical support she received, Bella was inspired to do a skydive. Afterwards she said, The skydive was an incredible experience, overwhelming but amazing. I couldn’t be happier with the amount of money raised for the Teenage Cancer Trust. The TCT were an incredible unit and I don’t know how I would have coped without them in my cancer journey. Bella’s bravery and fighting spirit on the day raised nearly £5,000 Dance the ‘Zumba’ way The culmination of an extensive series of fundraising events for the TCT was our whole school Zumbathon. Through the dedicated efforts of our eleven houses, individuals and the full College community, this special event raised a significant, generous sponsorship. At first, it was just a rumour… then came the posters… then the long awaited announcement of Cheltenham College’s 2019 ‘Zumbathon’; our final challenge to face in order to reach our £28,000 aim for the Teenage Cancer Trust.

Momentum aims to give academy schools access to the alumni networks of independent school partners in order to increase opportunity and social mobility. A small number of high potential pupils from the academy are selected to attend a two-week placement in London where they are mentored through different business options and take part in small group training sessions where they are mentored on projects in an “ Apprentice” style in order to develop business acumen, presentational skills, confidence and leadership. Cheltenham College has financed two places on the London introduction to business course for Summer 2017 and a further three for Summer 2018 (one of whom will be on medical placements). Pupils subsequently return for three annual summer work experience internships which are increasingly tailored to their careers of choice. At a more local level the partnership will be developed to help offer work experience, interviews and mentoring opportunities for both gateway careers (where work experience is needed, such as medicine) and also more specialist roles.

We encourage our pupils to see themselves as part of this wider community as well as our College community. Their involvement in these activities not only helps our pupils to make a difference in their local community but also develops the virtue of voluntary service and an awareness of communities of disadvantage, deprivation and disability. It builds valuable life skills that supports pupils’ Higher Education applications and entry into the world of work. We provide volunteering opportunities under the main headings of care homes, charity shops, schools and children care centres. In the past year, our pupils have contributed their time and skills to: Charity shops including Age UK, Daisychain Benevolent Fund and Longfield Local community amenities including Sandford Park, Cheltenham General Hospital and Cleeve Common Care homes including Abbeyfield, Windsor Street Care Centre, Thirlestaine Park Care Home, Bay Tree Court Care Centre, Charlton Kings Care Home and Faithfull House Local youth groups including Tewkesbury Baptist Church and Holy Trinity Tewkesbury Charities including The Chamwell Centre and the Momentum mentoring scheme that matches the talent of Academy school leavers with the opportunities provided by private school alumni networks.

Our educational partnerships are becoming an increasingly important aspect of College life and we can see that our school is benefitting from them in many ways. Our teachers are gaining from partnership projects and much is being learnt from working alongside fellow professionals. Our pupils too are benefitting: as they share learning experiences with pupils from other schools, relationships are formed and social barriers are dissolved. At other times, especially when they are involved in the educational aspects of the Community Action Programme, they are actively involved in serving their local community. This is important to us since College is a school that has always put a sense of service at the core of the values we want our pupils to take with them into the world. This brochure gives you an insight into the projects where we work in partnership with other schools, and I hope it provides you with a flavour of why we believe partnerships are the way forward. Nicola Huggett, Head of Cheltenham College 3 Educational Partnerships INTRODUCTION It is a rewarding time to be overseeing partnerships at Cheltenham College. ‘Independent State School Partnerships’ – referred to as ISSPs – are blossoming all over the country. The old educational ‘distance’ between the two sectors is rapidly vanishing and is being replaced by meaningful partnerships which are collaborative, mutually respectful and reciprocal. This is definitely the approach we have adopted at Cheltenham College and we are fortunate to find ourselves in partnership with educational leaders and teachers across the town who subscribe to the same philosophy. This brochure is a snapshot of the partnership projects which have been developed over the last two to three years. Also included are the partnerships we have developed with schools and educational charities in Europe, Africa and Asia. There is much here of which College can be proud; staff and pupils are clearly embracing the many positive possibilities that partnerships offer. The task over the next few years will be to continue this work, expanding and deepening our partnerships, and thereby widening the life-opportunities of young people in our shared community. Dr Adam Dunning, Director of PartnershipsTHE PARTNERSHIP TEAM Bel Cornwell – Partnership Administrator Karl Cook – Sport Partnership Co -or dinator Alayne Parsley – Partnership Co -or dinator (The Prep) Julia Hande – Community Action Co -o rdinator (College) NB. In this publication, Cheltenham College (Senior School) will simply be referred to as ‘College’ and Cheltenham College Preparatory School as ‘The Prep’. The term ‘Cheltenham College’, when used, incorporates both schools. 4 Educational PartnershipsEDUCATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS – OUR PHILOSOPHY There are a number of reasons why Cheltenham College is involved in educational p artnerships: 1. P artnerships are the right thing to do . Partnerships enable an independent school to fulfil its historic and moral purpose as a charitable educational institution. 2. A s chool in a partnership is better than a school that isn’t. This is because such a school has become an outward-facing institution, open to learning and receiving, as well as open to giving and sharing. Since partnerships are characterised by reciprocity , a partnership improves practice and leads to a richer, more diverse experience for pupils. 3. T he positive benefits of partnerships extend into the local community . As well as benefitting the pupils and staff of the schools in a partnership (e.g., raising the aspirations and increasing life-opportunities of pupils) the wider community also benefits. It is through our partnership activity that we become more closely connected with the town and community of Cheltenham. We have no doubt that, through the sharing of expertise with our partners, everybody involved is enriched. Staff at our two schools are now encouraged to look outwards and to be receptive to how best practice in a partnered school can be incorporated back into the life of College and The Prep. CATEGORISING OUR PARTNERSHIPS Our educational partnerships fall into two categories: • W here we seek to build on links with schools"}

CATEGORISING OUR PARTNERSHIPS Our educational partnerships fall into two categories: • W here we seek to build on links with schools in the nearby and wider community, through shared experience and good practice. • O verseas relationships where our aim is to improve the lives of children by providing educational and practical support. We approach our partnerships with schools in the nearby and wider community in the following ways: • En hanced Partnerships – these are formal, long-term and wide-ranging partnerships, each framed by a Memorandum of Understanding. College is partnered with All Saints’ Academy, while The Prep is partnered with Saint John’s Church of England Primary School. • P artnership projects – these include i) long-term relationships with local schools which centre on a specific project; ii) annual events involving local schools led by a College or Prep School department; iii) ongoing partnership programmes involving schools and sporting or charitable organisations. 5 Educational Partnerships Part One: Enhanced Educational Partnerships 6 Educational PartnershipsALL SAINTS’ ACADEMY Our partnership with All Saints’ Academy dates back to September 2015. This is the key partnership for College. All Saints’ Academy opened in 2011 and is based in the west of Cheltenham. The Academy is led by Principal Dermot McNiffe. It is a church school with a shared Church of England and Roman Catholic identity. Our two schools recently agreed a Memorandum of Understanding which recognised that both shared: • Com mitment to educational excellence • C ommitment to the community of Cheltenham • C hristian ethosThe Memorandum of Understanding commits the two schools to an enhanced level of partnerships in the following areas: • Academic improvement • A cademic enrichment • H igher Education and Careers • P rofessional collaboration • L ogistical assistance • Ext ra-curricular (i.e. Sport, Music, Art, DofE, and CCF) Since the partnership began in 2015 much has already been achieved. College is delighted to have seen the participation of Academy students in the following activities and programmes: • H igher Education Conference • P re-university week experience • C areers fair • U CAS training • M ini-MBA programme • U CAS personal statement training • M edicine, Dentistry and Veterinary Science programme • R owing experience on the River Severn • T he 7 Up Programme (see ‘Partnership Close-up’ on page 8) College has also offered the use of its facilities and teaching spaces. Some of our staff have been seconded to teach weekly lessons at the Academy, whilst others have been keen to mentor colleagues as they undertake new responsibilities. A joint meeting of the Academic Common Rooms in September was another key milestone in the partnership. College has benefitted enormously from the partnership with the Academy, gaining valuable insights in how data can be collected and used to improve academic outcomes. The Academy also hosts many of our students who have enrolled in the Community Action Programme. College pupils visit the Academy on a weekly basis and act as classroom assistants, lab technicians, and sports coaches. 7 Educational PartnershipsCollege has helped to fund the work of the charity ‘Momentum’ at the Academy. Momentum helps provide HE and Careers advice in general, and specific support for a more limited number of individuals to gain work experience, CV writing guidance, interview support and internships with relevant business contacts. A key aspect of partnership is that it is a two-way relationship. Over 40 members of staff across both schools are now actively involved in planning and delivering partnership projects. The projects planned for 2018-19 aim to bring the two schools closer together in the following areas: • S afeguarding and pastoral care • F inancial best practice • D ata capture and application • P rofessional development • I nduction"}

We have collaboratively created an ambitious educational programme with sincere partnership at the core, which I believe will be highly regarded as a model of excellence for formal partnership between independent and state sector schools once the impact of our joint venture is realised. Dermot McNiffe (Principal of All Saints’ Academy) It is a pleasure to be working alongside staff and senior leaders at All Saints’ Academy to ensure that the young people in our care are given the best all-round educational experience. As educators, both schools put pupils at the centre of our decision making, and I have no doubt that as we continue to work with All Saints’ Academy, this will help pupils in both schools. The opportunities for staff to develop alongside one another has also proved to be a real source of inspiration. We look forward to continuing to build on the strong foundations that have been laid over the coming years. Nicola Huggett (Head of Cheltenham College) 8 Educational PartnershipsPARTNERSHIP CLOSE-UP – THE 7 UP PROGRAMME Between January and May 2018, a group of 35 Year 11 pupils from the Academy came weekly to College. They experienced two hours’ worth of Maths and English extension teaching. The aim of this programme was to raise their GCSE grades in Maths and English to 8 and 9. This programme will be repeated again next academic year with Physics being included alongside Maths and English. During my time spent working in the 7 Up Programme my confidence increased dramatically. I feel the programme really helped my progress in Maths and I feel this will be reflected in my summer results. Jess (Academy pupil) The 7 Up Maths Programme was hugely beneficial in promoting the confidence of pupils and consolidating the skills needed to achieve the highest grades in GCSE Maths. Working with teachers from both schools enabled students to recognise that Maths concepts are universal and encouraged them to realise they had the knowledge and tools available to perform well. Liz Wife (Head of Maths) It’s been an absolute pleasure to work with the English Department at Cheltenham College. As staff, we were given opportunities to make valuable links, share best practice and exam knowledge. I know the students value the experience they had, and feel that it has contributed to the progress they made. I’m sure our partnership will continue to benefit both schools – staff and students – for years to come. Tim Kendry (English Department) The English Language sessions at Cheltenham College were really beneficial to my understanding and confidence. Thank you for inviting me to be part of the programme.

They have been excellent ambassadors for College. • C ollaboration between History Departments at both schools has helped to enhance the quality of teaching provided through shared expertise. The impact of this collaboration has led to an improved History scheme of learning, as well as a range of new teaching ideas being used in the classroom. • A L evel Business students from the Academy have been taking part in the Mini-MBA Extended Enrichment Programme at College. The students have thoroughly enjoyed the entrepreneurial challenge, mixing with College pupils and attempting to create a new commercial product or service. The impact has been a rise in self-confidence amongst All Saints’ students which is reflected back in class discussions and preparation for examinations. 9 Educational PartnershipsSAINT JOHN’ S CHURCH OF ENGLAND PRIMARY SCHOOL Our partnership with Saint John’s Church of England Primary School began in the spring of 2017. This is the key partnership for The Prep. Saint John’s is situated in the centre of Cheltenham and its current Headteacher is Juliette Moxhan. Established in 1872, only 30 years after College’s foundation, the school has 200 pupils on its roll, 35% of whom have English as an additional language. With its long history, close proximity to College and its Christian ethos, Saint John’s was a natural partner for The Prep. Saint John’s is rated ‘Good’ by Ofsted and recently achieved an ‘Outstanding’ rating for its spiritual provision (SIAMS). Given its town-centre location, its most pressing need was for an open space and an expansion of its sporting provision. We have been able to meet this need in the following ways: • Y ear 6 pupils enjoy an annual post-SATs activity programme delivered by College sports professionals• Y ear 2 pupils attend The Prep on a weekly basis for PE lessons • T he Saint John’s Sports’ Day was held on The Prep sports fields • W eekly swimming lessons take place at College’s Sports Hall The broader partnership has developed very quickly and the following partnership projects have taken place: • T he Art and D&T Departments have hosted workshops • P upils from Key Stage 1 from both schools enjoyed a choral experience day (see ‘Partnership Close-up’ on page 11) • T he Maths Department hosted a joint school workshop on Dyscalculia • S aint John’s has been gifted with its own minibus • T he expertise of a videographer has enabled the production of a marketing video for Saint John’s 10 Educational PartnershipsBoth sets of staff are now invited to attend CPD and Inset training, and trainee teachers from The Prep have been offered placements at Saint John’s as part of the process of obtaining a PGCE. The Prep has benefitted from the partnership in several ways: • V olunteering opportunities for our Year 8 pupils • D eveloping its anti-bullying programme • P eer observations between teachers from the two schools Pupils from College also visit Saint John’s, where they get involved with classroom assistant reading activities and EAL support. We also identified the opportunity for those Saint John’s pupils interested in singing to join our new boys’ and girls’ Chapel choirs (see ‘The Chorister Scheme’ on page 16). This has proved to be a wonderfully enriching experience for all involved.

There has been a genuine ‘meeting of minds’ over many aspects of education, and at the heart of our aims has been what is best for all children. My thanks go to the Saint John’s community who have embraced this idea with enthusiasm and energy and I hope that it will serve pupils at both schools for many years to come. Tom O’Sullivan (Head of The Prep) Saint John’s is delighted to be working in partnership with Cheltenham College Prep School. Cheltenham Prep offers us some amazing opportunities which benefit all pupils, including the most vulnerable. The minibus that they have given us is fantastic and enables us to participate in a huge number of extra-curricular activities offsite that previously we could not get to. It as an exciting, dynamic and evolving partnership, one in which we learn from each other, with the aim of improving outcomes for all pupils at its heart. Juliette Moxham (Headteacher of Saint John’s Primary School) 11 Educational Partnerships PARTNERSHIP CLOSE-UP – CHORAL CONCERT In May 2018 our partner schools (Saint John’s and Gloucester Road), joined together with pupils from The Prep in order to sing a full and varied repertoire of music in College Chapel. Much hard work went into preparing for this collaborative event, both by Prep Music teachers and partnership staff. The children, all from Year 4, were rehearsed well and evidently got great pleasure from singing together. The concert itself was a celebration of what can be achieved through partnership activity. The children rose to the occasion, singing When I Grow Up (Matilda), This Little Light of Mine, I Close My Eyes (Joseph), and Shine, Jesus, Shine . Choral /adj. Engaged in or concerned with singing. 12 Educational Partnerships Part Two: Partnership Projects 13 Educational PartnershipsTHE MILESTONE SCHOOL Our partnership with The Milestone School began in 2016. The Milestone School is a large state school in Gloucester which caters for children with a wide range of SEN from 2-16 years of age. Working with The Milestone School provides unique opportunities for us to contribute to the wellbeing of children who have severe or profound learning disabilities. During these formative years of our partnership, it is clearly evident that special bonds have developed between Milestone and College pupils.

During these formative years of our partnership, it is clearly evident that special bonds have developed between Milestone and College pupils. The key activities that we are involved in include: College Sixth Form helping in the Milestone community A group of Year 12 aspiring university medical students visit The Milestone School weekly in order to offer support to individual children. Through play sessions and reading to the pupils, they begin to develop an understanding of the children’s complex needs. They gain a further insight into the extraordinary challenges that other people face in life. The virtues of patience and attentiveness are reinforced, while at the same time building on their own communication skills. Opportunities for aspiring medical students As part of the partnership, students from College who are interested in training to be doctors are invited to The Milestone School to join with a group of fourth year medical students from Bristol University. They benefit significantly from a regular programme of training led by consultant paediatrician Dr Marie Owen and specialist teacher Zsuzsanna Takacs. They also gain from interacting with their older university peers, which gives a valuable insight into the demands of undertaking a medical degree. Musical partnership At the outset of the partnership, College donated two pianos for Milestone pupils to access. Music is a source of great joy and stimulation to pupils and the access to more pianos has greatly enhanced this. One Milestone pupil is a talented pianist and has loved serenading all the pupils with Abba songs during break times. This has built her friendship group and raised her self-esteem. College has donated a further piano which is used to teach music to a gifted blind pupil. The main focus of the partnership has been to develop a close relationship between pupils at both schools. All of the 312 pupils at The Milestone School have severe or profound learning disabilities and many have complex physical disabilities too. It has been wonderful for them to have students from College helping in their classrooms; it has provided the opportunity to make friends and accept help from peers rather than be dependent on adult staff to support them. Our pupils have benefitted from social conversations with other young people who share similar interests around music and sport and teenage life. The students from College have gained a valuable insight into disability, and how our pupils do not let their problems stop them from enjoying life to the full and how brave and tenacious they are. Lyn Dance (Headteacher, The Milestone School) 14 Educational PartnershipsTHE BATTLEDOWN CENTRE Our partnership with the Battledown Centre began in 2017. Battledown is based in Cheltenham and provides a specialist education for children with a wide spectrum of additional needs, such as autism and speech and language. Our joint aim is to foster sustainable links between our two very different educational settings that will last well into the future. College pupils are involved in helping Battledown children during story times, where they use the ‘Story Massage’ technique. • P upils are taught how to deliver the ten core Story Massage strokes, to highlight the progression of a story • S essions actively encourage communication and help forge new trust-based friendships for all parties involved • P upils work closely with Battledown staff, learning how to adapt to children’s changing moods, physical and emotional needs• T he qualities of empathy and sensitivity towards others are intrinsically encouraged, by working in a challenging and unpredictable environment Our partnership with Battledown has a unique quality. The nature of our involvement relies on a one-to-one pupil investment of time and emotional awareness, in order to build positive relationships.

It is great to raise awareness of additional needs and work together. Nikki Teague (Acting Headteacher, The Battledown Centre) 15 Educational PartnershipsSCIENCE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CATHOLIC SCHOOL OF SAINT GREGORY THE GREAT Since establishing our partnership in 2014 College has provided Saint Gregory’s School with enhanced learning opportunities in the areas of Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Design & Technology. Pupils from Saint Gregory’s benefit from the use of our dedicated Science facilities where they get the opportunity to work with ‘real-life’ experiments and science -ba sed problems. In partnership we aim to: • I nspire young pupils to become interested in and curious about the sciences • G ive young pupils exposure to working with ‘real-life’ experiments and science-based problems • I dentify scientists of the future How do we achieve this? College hosts a number of Science workshops during the year, to which Year 6 pupils from Saint Gregory’s are invited. The pupils rotate through the three science disciplines using specialist equipment to undertake laboratory-based experiments. Whole class Saint Gregory’s workshops that have taken place, taught by our specialist Science teachers, include: • B iology – Owl pellet dissection • P hysics – Introduction to forces, light and sound • C hemistry – Energy from chemicals Future College pupil involvement All Science workshops are currently run by College teaching staff. New plans are proposed to involve College Sixth Form students in the delivery of workshops which will take place from September 2018. This will have the added benefit of younger Saint Gregory’s pupils being inspired by working with their older peers. The Catholic School of Saint Gregory the Great is very happy to be working in partnership with Cheltenham College. In their weekly afternoon visits to us the students support both pupils and teachers, always being polite, considerate and willing to take on any role in order to help. Our children often look forward to the times when they are working alongside the ‘big boys and girls’! The pupils at our school also benefit greatly from participating in Science events, particularly the Biology and Physics workshops, and Maths Challenge Days hosted by Cheltenham College, providing our children with exciting experiences that they are keen to explore further. Olivia Lines, (Acting Headteacher, Saint Gregory’s School) 16 Educational PartnershipsSCIENCE PARTNERSHIP – YOUNG SCIENTIST DAY Each year The Prep hosts the ‘Young Scientist Day’ event as part of the Cheltenham Science Festival. Pupils from local primary schools join some of our pupils for a day of Science and Design & Technology lessons. The theme in 2018 was ‘Communication’ , and the day was designed to promote Science and Design & Technology to all our young learners. In the Biochemistry activity, the pupils learnt how animals can change colour to communicate their feelings. In Physics, they discovered how energy, but not particles, can be transferred. The Design & Technology activity allowed the pupils to design and create a keyring which was cut out on a laser. Pupils received an introduction to graphic design by using 2D Corel Draw and then also 3D design using Google SketchUp. The day finished with an entertaining and interactive performance by the charismatic Gastronaut Stefan Gates. The schools which were represented at YSD were: • A vening Primary School • C astle Hill Primary School • C hurchdown Village Primary School • S aint John’s C of E Primary School"}

They are each auditioned treble lines of 20 choristers ranging from Years 3 to 8, drawn from The Prep and Saint John’s Primary School. They are supplemented by boys in the College Third and Fourth Form. In addition, pupils from Bishop’s Cleeve School and Saint James’ School have also become choristers during the year. The Boy and Girl Choristers rehearse separately twice a week and each join the College Schola Cantorum alto, tenor and bass parts for Choral Evensongs once per month. In the very short time that these two groups have been together a remarkable amount has been achieved by the very talented, committed and hardworking choristers. They now have a range of repertoire from 17 Educational Partnershipswhich to draw for their regular services, and teach to next year’s new intake of choristers. They represent a very bright future of singing at College as well as their own schools. The Chorister Scheme partnership has the following benefits for pupils at College: • O pportunity to sing with treble voices • L eadership opportunities for older students • E arly training of musicians before they arrive at College It has further benefits for pupils from The Prep:• S inging with pupils from other schools • C ollaboration of The Prep and College • V isibility within the local community It benefits pupils from Saint John’s School since they:• B ecome part of the regular College Chapel community • T ake their musical experiences back to their existing instrumental and choral groupsIt also benefits all participants from College, The Prep and Saint John’s with opportunities in: • L eadership • T eam work • P ublic speaking • C onfidence • Po sture • Mu sicianship Pupils who are part of the Schola Cantorum Choristers absolutely love the whole experience and are very proud to be part of such a prestigious choir. They are now able to engage with a whole new area of music that was previously unknown to them. Juliette Moxham (Headteacher of Saint John’s Primary School) 18 Educational PartnershipsDESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY PARTNERSHIP WITH GOTHERINGTON PRIMARY SCHOOL In 2017 the Design & Technology Department hosted a group of Year 6 pupils from Gotherington Primary School. The visit was a culmination of a long-term project which saw them designing and making model Anderson shelters (the Design & Technology element of their overarching project on the Second World War). The climax of the day was the final testing phase, during which the students dropped weights from an ever-increasing height to see how stable and durable their structures were! As with any successful partnership, there were benefits for both parties. For the primary school pupils these included: • Off ering them the chance to build the practical skills that are required by the National Curriculum but which are difficult to gain in their normal environment• H elping to build an interest in the subject of Design & Technology that could ultimately see them forging successful careers in areas such as product design, engineering, architecture and fashion • B uilding the skills to help them problem solve and develop practical solutions to real life problems For the College pupils, and in particular the Fourth Form GCSE groups who helped out at various stages during the day, the benefits included: • G aining experience of having to communicate effectively through teaching others new"}

The lecture has been outward looking from its inception, and remains an important way through which the English Department seeks to develop its links with the wider community. This year we welcomed 300 students and staff from nine Gloucestershire schools, including All Saints’ Academy, Balcarras and Pate’s Grammar School, to hear Sir Jonathan Bate, Provost of Worcester College, University of Oxford, speak to us about Shakespeare’s classical education and, in particular, its influence on three of his plays, Coriolanus, Richard III, and Hamlet. A s part of the event, we were also able to display three highly commended entries to All Saints’ Year 7 model Globe Theatre competition, with the winning entry drawing particular praise from our speaker. 20 Educational PartnershipsSPORTS PARTNERSHIPS College’s sporting partnership programme has grown impressively in recent years. These partnerships make it possible for College coaches and pupils to invest their time and expertise to increase sport and physical activity within the local community and further afield. Gloucestershire County Cricket Club and the Gloucestershire Cricket Board Not only do we stage one of the most successful and longest standing county cricket festivals in the country, we also host the county and district winter training programme at every age group from U12 to U16. Charlton Kings Cricket Club This local cricket club has used our facilities to help grow its membership. Girls’ cricket has been played on one of our fields. Senior men’s cricket has netted, and had fixtures against College boys, girls and staff. After the first full season, College’s cricket club gained a bowling machine from this partnership, which in turn helped to improve the cricket provision we can offer both to our own pupils and to visiting schools. County Primary Schools’ Kwik Cricket Finals The Kwik Cricket Finals Day is something College has hosted for at least the past five years. It is the culmination of a Gloucestershire Cricket Board initiative to grow cricket in local primary schools. Gloucester Swimming Club Our top swimmers benefitted from additional coaching sessions, participating in a training camp abroad, and also from integrating with a number of county and national level swimmers at Gloucester Swimming Club. Community Hockey Our coaches have established a weekly community hockey session, allowing young boys and girls from the local area to try hockey and develop basic skills. 21 Educational PartnershipsCounty Hockey and Cheltenham Hockey Club (CHC) College hosts all age group county tournaments from U14 up to U18 for the Gloucester Hockey Association. These tournaments are designed specifically for those schools that wish to play only within their locality. College provides CHC with a training base for all ages - from junior up to seniors - in both genders. We also host their National League games for the Men’s 1st XI.

This session targets primary school children who do not engage in their PE or sports lessons. College’s facilities, especially the Sports Hall, allow these children to experience many different types of sporting activity. Cheltenham Town Football Club College worked in conjunction with Cheltenham Town Football Club to launch football at College. College pupils will be looking to ‘buddy up’ with Academy players and to enter schools to assist with lunchtime coaching sessions. Saint John’s School Pupils from Saint John’s School now join Year 1 and Reception games lessons every week at The Prep. Tag rugby and netball sessions were run by College sports professionals, and this programme culminated in a fixture against Dean Close School. Gloucester RFC Gloucester RFC is an ‘official educational partner’. College has a long-standing relationship, with over 20 pupils representing the Academy across five age groups. Two pupils have also recently been awarded senior professional contracts. We offer the ‘mascot experience’ during which a selected pupil (internal/external) not only leads the premiership team out at Kingsholm before kick-off but also tours the stadium and meets with the players. Old Patsonians RFC There is an established link with this local club allowing their junior age groups to use College pitches for training and matches. The Old Pats have assisted College with the supply of referees and coaches throughout the rugby term, with College returning the favour and, in addition, leading coaching sessions with their U15 and U16 teams. Gloucester Wheelchair Rugby College invited the head of Gloucester Wheelchair Rugby to give our pupils an insight into the sport. It was a fantastic occasion, putting into perspective how physically demanding the sport is, and providing College pupils with an opportunity to share experiences. 22 Educational PartnershipsCOMMUNITY ACTION IN PARTNER SCHOOLS Through the voluntary giving of their time and talents, College pupils are encouraged to develop within themselves a spirit of service, thereby making a meaningful contribution to the wider Cheltenham community. Every week pupils in the Fourth and Sixth Form help out in local schools in a variety of roles: • C lassroo m assistants • Sp orts coaches • A ssistant therapists • L aboratory assistants • R eading partners Our work in schools aims to: • B uild confidence and achievement in others • E ncourage learning through peer example • S hare high quality educational practice • P romote inclusivity Through which College pupils: • B ecome more aware of the needs of their wider community • Ex perience communities of difference and disadvantage • L earn more about themselves The schools participating in our Community Action Programme include:• A ll Saints’ Academy • Ho p Skip Jump • N aunton Park Primary School • O akwood Primary School • S aint John’s Primary School • T he Battledown Centre • T he Catholic School of Saint Gregory the Great • T he Milestone S chool Since the establishment of the partnership between Cheltenham College and Oakwood Primary School we have seen a number of positive outcomes.

They train once per week at their base in London and have a number of summer fixtures, which culminate in a week-long tour to Gloucestershire, where they stay in one of the College Boarding Houses. College provides the accommodation, facilities and transport free of charge, and College pupils take the lead in arranging fixtures. In addition we sent a vehicle full of cricket whites, bats, kit, blazers and training clothing so that the boys’ identity is as cricketers rather than refugees when they take part in games. The first tour was in 2016 and this has now been established as an enduring commitment.

During this time College has supported the school in the vital re-building, renovation and development of its entirety. We have achieved this in partnership with the Vanessa Grant Trust and the inspirational leadership of Gogar’s Headmistress, Sister Hiltrude. Over the years College pupils have had the privilege of visiting and working with the children of Gogar. Where did it all start? The school formerly consisted of eight rundown classrooms, a few desks and squalid latrines. Our support has now funded: • T he building, renovation and equipping of classrooms • T he building of the library and school kitchen• T he construction of latrines and a water-collecting system • T he landscaping of the school grounds to alleviate the effects of heavy rain • T he building of the Volunteer Accommodation centre Educational Sponsorship In collaboration with the Vanessa Grant Trust, College has been sponsoring the education of two under-privileged children, Ernest and Diana, which will continue through to the end of their secondary school education. Both are making excellent progress and are keen to become doctors. College met with the Vanessa Grant Trust in January 2018 in Gogar to ensure the smooth running of current projects. The highlight was, of course, meeting Ernest and Diana. They discussed their schooling, needs and ambitions. College is profoundly grateful to the Vanessa Grant Trust, without whom, none of the work we have been part of would have been possible. 27 Educational PartnershipsRESIDENTIAL SCHOOL FOR CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS IN BRADET (ROMANIA) Our connection with the Residential School for Children with Special Needs in Bradet, Romania, began in 2000.

Over the years our work with Bradet has developed far in excess of any original plans. There is no doubt that it has had a remarkably positive impact on the many people involved in it. How did it all begin? When College first visited Bradet School, the reality that faced us was children ‘three to a bed’ in a chaotic and dangerous environment, known locally as ‘the black hole’. As a result of that visit, the then Head of Biology was inspired to do something radical about the appalling living conditions he found. His first initiative was to recruit over 40 College pupils to fundraise by cycling the entire way from College to Bradet. Since then, the partnership has flourished and remains alive and vibrant throughout both schools. Fundraising Over the years, thousands of pounds have been raised at College’s annual Variety Show and by pupils inspired to undertake fundraising challenges such as the Whole School Walk, Land’s End to John O’ Groats and Iron Curtain sponsored bike rides, Three Peaks walks, Cheltenham half marathons and fashion shows. These have enabled the: • E ntire renovation and replacement of dormitories of 80 children with dorms for six • R efurbishment of the girls’ and boys’ houses• B uilding of Casa Chris - a transition house for young men over the age of 18 to live in as they develop independence at home and in work • B uilding of workshops, craft rooms and bike stores • I nstallation of fire escapes and smoke detection systems • P urchase and maintenance of ten BMX bikes, still going strong after ten years, thousands of miles of racing, around and even fire! • B uilding and maintenance of swings and a play fort • P rovision of dental care • P urchase of DIY equipment • R eceipt of hundreds of pairs of shoes and literally tonnes of donated ‘as new’ clothing • S olar panels to heat water • P urchase of play equipment, including stationery, colouring books, and thousands of balls! 28 Educational PartnershipsPupil Action Since 2000 hundreds of College pupils have had the privilege of volunteering at Bradet by joining our annual post-GCSE trip. Challenging, yet immensely rewarding, it is always a moving and unforgettable experience for everyone - perhaps best expressed in the words of our pupils themselves: The most important week of my life. It was an experience that I will never forget. Not a day has gone by since, when I haven’t looked around me and thought how lucky I am. I really have been inspired. Thank you. My time at Bradet was eye-opening and life-changing. The children made me feel so special and worthwhile. For me, going on the trip really helped me grow as a person; being out of my comfort zone pushed me to learn more about myself and my limits. SHAMROCK SCHOOL (NEPAL) The Shamrock School in Pokhara, Nepal, is the most long- standing of our overseas partnerships. It was founded in 1998 with support from a former College parent. Shamrock is a small boarding school educating 68 children (aged between 10 and 16) from the surrounding area towards the Nepalese School Leaving Certificate (SLC).

This equates to about 15% of the total overall revenue required. There is much more work still to be done, both in attracting more students and developing the very basic facilities. 30 Educational PartnershipsLANGA PRE-SCHOOL ( SOUTH AFRICA) Our partnership with the UK Langa Township Pre-S chool Trust (LTPT) goes back to spring 2014. This has enabled us to support underprivileged children in Cape Town and has been pivotal to the work of the Trust. LTPT supports 240 children in the Langa Township and was set up by Gordon and Pam Gaddes, grandparents of a former College pupil. College’s support has been vital to enabling LTPT to improve conditions in the pre-schools: • T he 2014 College Rugby Tour to South Africa presented a cheque for £4,000 to provide much-needed security fencing for Dalukhanyo Pre-School in 2015 • T he Chapel Christmas Carol services in 2016 collected £6,000 which was then spent on clothing, vegetables and furniture for both the Dalukhanyo and Nomonde Pre-Schools • A d onation of £3,000 contributed to the establishment of modern office facilities, seen as the essential basis for the pre-schools becoming more self-sufficient T he Trust has now established a three-year project to support Nomonde Pre-S chool, located in a very poor shacks area, the target being to raise and spend £36,000 by 2021, LTPT’s 10th Anniversary. KEY FACTS AND FIGURES 20 1 7 - 1 8 £83,500 is the amount given to our partnership projects in the UK. This includes staff costs, the purchase of resources, facilities use, transportation help and direct assistance. 1,900 Staff hours given in the calendar year 2017 to educational partnership projects with pupils in the state sector 1,600 hours were contributed by College-based staff to partnership projects 300 hours were contributed by Prep-based staff 12 members of staff contributed between 20 and 70 hours to p artnership projects 750 state sector pupils were positively affected by College- based partnership work 300 state sector pupils were positively affected by Prep- based partnership work 31 Educational Partnerships Thanks to those who have helped to put this brochure together and supplied images Andrew Banks Gill BarrettJane BrodiganKarl CookBelinda CornwellDom FaulknerGavin JohnsonLeo KellyDavid McKeeOlly MorganRichard PennyKit Perona-WrightMary PlintAndrew StraitonGwyn WilliamsChildcare Department, Brasov, Romania Gratitude /noun The quality of being thankful; readiness to show appreciation for and to return kindness. 32 Educational PartnershipsCheltenham College Bath Road Cheltenham Gloucestershire GL53 7LD Tel: +44 (0) 1242 265 600 Email: info@cheltenhamcollege.org www.cheltenhamcollege.org Registered Charity No. 311720OUR PARTNERS All Saints’ Academy Avening Primary School B alcarras School Bishop Cleeve SchoolCastle Hill Primary School Charlton Kings Cricket Club Cheltenham Hockey ClubCheltenham Town Football ClubChurchdown Village Primary School Da lukhanyo Pre-School (South Africa) Gloucester Road Primary SchoolGloucestershire County Cricket Club Gloucestershire Cricket Board Gloucester Rugby Football ClubGloucester Swimming Club Gloucester Wheelchair RugbyGogar Primary School (Kenya)Gotherington Primary SchoolHop Skip JumpHucclecote Netball Club Naunton Park Primary SchoolNomonde Pre-School (South Africa)Oakwood Primary SchoolOld Patsonians Rugby Football Club Pate’s Grammar SchoolResidential School for Children with Special Needs in Bradet (Romania) Saint"}

The Archive Department holds the official records of Cheltenham College, Cheltenham College Preparatory School, and the Cheltonian Society , as well as records relating to all aspects of College life. This includes letters, magazines, minutes, photographs, prints and drawings, programmes, and pupil registration forms. An extensive library, comprising books by (or about) Old Cheltonians, on the local area, military regiments and on schools and education, is also available for all to use. Visiting the Archive If you have a personal connection with Cheltenham College or are interested in studying the history of the school, you are welcome to get in touch. The College archives are open to researchers by appointment only, Monday to Friday 9.30am – 4.30pm (excluding public holidays). The Archives Team will be pleased to help and advise you with your research and may also undertake limited research on your behalf. This research service is undertaken at the discretion of the Archivist. Please note that there may be restricted or limited access to some records. Under the current data protection legislation, records containing the personal data of individuals are closed within their lifetime. However, any past pupil or employee may have access to material which relates solely to him or herself. College Timeline: The Anne Cadbury Room The Anne Cadbury Resource Room is an annex to the library which showcases the history of the College through photographs over the decades since the College was first founded. Download the booklet here to see the images from the timeline and the captions explaining what they represent. Donations If you have, or are aware of, any documents or artefacts relating to College or former pupils, staff or Council members then the Archives Team would love to hear from you. Contact For further information, please contact the Archives Team at archives@cheltenhamcollege.org .

The distinctive hats ‘Collegers’ were a key component of College uniform for its first hundred years. These pupils walked out of the quad in 1920s and this photograph captures the still familiar bustle of College life. \" Junior School Scrap Book, 1952-1953 I love this item. Most of the archive is records about pupils in The Prep and College but this is a wonderful account of life in The Prep created by the pupils and in their own words. It is full of beautiful illustrations and newspaper cuttings and tells you what the pupils thought was important to record for future generations. \" Building Plans 1850s-present The technical drawings of our College buildings are always particularly interesting. The College Archives serve the school by providing as full and thorough a picture of the school’s history as possible. An awareness of where we have come from allows us to build positively for the future.

Whether they are seeking a Day or Boarding place, the Cotswolds provides an opportunity for their children to experience a different environment, allowing them to grow and discover their full potential in a town famed for its educational excellence. Often referred to as the ‘Heart of The Cotswolds’, Cheltenham began as an Anglo-Saxon village 1,200 years ago.

With its beautiful regency architecture and stunning gardens, Cheltenham is the perfect setting for your child’s education.

It is the world’s longest running cricket festival on an outfield. It was first started in 1872 and has been held at College for over 140 years. The world renowned Cheltenham Festival takes place at the racecourse. This is the highlight of the racing calendar with 260,000+ race goers from Britain, Ireland and mainland Europe attending the festival. It is the 4th biggest sporting event in the UK.

Cheltenham College enables individuals to feel comfortable being themselves, so all members of the community are valued and can flourish. To this end, Cheltenham College is committed to equality of opportunity for pupils and staff. This underpins all parts of school life; for pupils, the curriculum, the co-curricular programmes and the social ethos. There have been a number of initiatives to celebrate diversity including; Celebration of Pride Month, Pupil and staff talks, Cultures Week, Ethnicities Week – open safe spaces to discuss discrimination experiences, East and Southeast Asian (ESEA) anti-racism training with external trainer Isabelle Pan, whole school Chapel talk by team members on stereotyping and micro-aggression, Staff training: unconscious bias, racial literacy (How to speak confidently about race), Educate and Celebrate (LGBTQ+ awareness) and LGBTQ+ listener, Bystander intervention campaign – Five ‘Bystander Training’ assemblies, presented by pupils to whole year groups on how to ‘call it out’ and stand up to micro-aggression and racism and bystander training led by staff, an independently-commissioned survey to inform development of anti-racist culture. Equality, Diversity and Inclusion at Cheltenham College is continually developing and evolving. Alongside our EDI policies and CPD training for staff, our pupils have formed and are leading proactive committees such as the Anti-Racism Team and the LGBTQ+ Committee to support EDI initiatives. Each pupil group leads discussions and assemblies, holds events and takes part in training and education on EDI areas; and our trained academic and pastoral staff provide support to pupils. Meet the Anti-Racism Team The Anti Racism (A-R) Team was set up at the start of 2023 and its mission is to make Cheltenham College entirely accepting of the wide diversity of race and ethnicity within the community. The group has grown from 35 to 75 pupils (Years 11 to 13), and we expect membership to grow considerably with this term’s annual recruitment drives. All members have attended bystander training. There are talks from external specialists on topics such as ‘Representation Matters’ and there is training with a focus on EASEA minorities in the UK. Team members are easily identified by a badge they wear displaying a logo designed by them. This is also used on posters alongside the names and photographs of all of its members, which is displayed across College. Our mission is to create a school community where all people are treated with dignity, respect, and fairness, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background.

The school is opposed to all forms of discrimination and work is undertaken with the school community, parents and other agencies to ensure that any form of discriminatory behaviour is taken seriously and measures put in place to prevent any repetition. Harassment in all its forms is unacceptable; Cheltenham College’s Behaviour, Anti-Bullying and Child on Child Abuse Policies contain clear procedures for dealing with discrimination. Bursaries are an integral part of our approach to equal opportunities. The school’s aim is to enable as many as possible who meet the admission criteria to attend Cheltenham College. The Bursary Policy is thus made available on the school website. Cheltenham College is seeking to increase the diversity of its staff body, recognising the importance of representation within the context of our multicultural society within and beyond College. Staff are selected on the basis of their professional suitability for the role and their ability to undertake required responsibilities. All staff play an active role in implementing Cheltenham College’s Equality and Diversity Policy. Use is made of tutorials, assemblies, Floreat, Thrive and in the curricular and co-curricular programmes for staff to: Promote tolerance of and respect towards others Act as role-models in challenging any form of prejudice and raising awareness of protected characteristics Foster open-mindedness and encouraging pupils to recognise and celebrate the contributions made by others, irrespective of age, sex, sexual orientation, ability, cultural heritage or faith Understand why and how to deal with hurtful and offensive language and behaviour, whether overt or more subtle or indirect Understand why any incidents are dealt with promptly and in a sensitively, supporting the party that has been hurt /offended and developing the understanding of the offender Culture, ethnicity, race Cheltenham College celebrates the diversity of its pupil body. Pupils should be able to feel proud of their cultural identity, confident that they are accepted and happy to share in the multi-cultural nature of Cheltenham College and the wider society. Multilingualism is recognised as advantageous, particularly within the increasingly inter-dependent and globalised society. Within College, we acknowledge that conversing with others in one’s home-language is important in maintaining identity and a sense of comfort and belonging.

Pupils should be able to feel proud of their cultural identity, confident that they are accepted and happy to share in the multi-cultural nature of Cheltenham College and the wider society. Multilingualism is recognised as advantageous, particularly within the increasingly inter-dependent and globalised society. Within College, we acknowledge that conversing with others in one’s home-language is important in maintaining identity and a sense of comfort and belonging. It is also important that international pupils become fully competent speakers of English, and this is especially important socially and in preparation for life beyond College. We therefore encourage a balance in language usage. Whatever their home language, pupils are requested to ‘read the room’ and ensure their language is not exclusionary. Cheltenham College actively promotes social and cultural harmony, respect, understanding and tolerance. Ability and difference Although Cheltenham College is academically selective it is nevertheless committed to the principles of inclusion. The school is able to meet the needs of pupils with mild learning differences and neurodiversity. The teaching, learning, achievement, attitude and wellbeing of all children matters; teachers adapt teaching and learning tasks to support learners and pastoral staff are sensitive to individual need. Both the Prep and Senior Schools have Learning Support Departments. Faith Although Cheltenham College has Christian roots, it welcomes pupils and staff of all faiths and none. Arrangements are made for those who are active in practising other faiths are able to do so. Chapel plays a key role in the life of Cheltenham College; it is the place where the whole College community gathers together most weekday mornings. Its role in generating a sense of unity and shared purpose is fundamental to College life. Events of importance and community matters are communicated and key achievements celebrated in Chapel. The values and stories underpinning Judeo-Christian world-view are sensitively explored and the key festivals of other major faiths are marked. Recognising that many pupils come from either another faith or post-Christian background, the themes of Chapel talks are drawn from a universal pool of wisdom concerned with living the good life. Cheltenham College aims that Chapel should be inclusive but recognises that some pupils who have an active and deep commitment to another faith may wish instead to use their time to practice their own devotions. A process is in place for requesting such withdrawal. Requests for variations in the school uniform and school practice From Pre-Prep upwards, all pupils at Cheltenham College are required to wear a uniform. The Heads consider written requests from parents for variations in the uniform that are consistent with the school’s ethos and its policy on health and safety. They may take expert advice, and normally arrange to meet with the parents to discuss the implications of such a request. Provision is made as necessary for special dietary requirements. Sex, sexual orientation and gender reassignment As a co-educational school, it is essential that pupils experience equality of educational opportunity. Being treated equally does not necessarily mean being treated exactly the same and staff members proactively avoid stereotypes and promote practices which yield positive outcomes in respect of sex, sexual orientation and gender reassignment. An Inclusion Committee comprising staff from the Prep and College meets regularly to implement improvements to co-education at Cheltenham College. Discussion about relationships and responsibility form part of the Floreat and Thrive! (PSHCE) programmes. Pupils are recognised as individuals. Matters relating to sexual orientation or gender identity are treated with discretion by any staff member to whom a pupil discloses matters of a sensitive nature. A counsellor is available to pupils and confidentiality is observed. A pupil who may be questioning their sexual orientation, gender identity or considering transitioning will be supported in this process, through trained personnel, including staff in the Health Centre and Pupil / Student Support Services where appropriate. Support takes the form of helping a pupil to explore their own identity; the school does not promote a particular lifestyle. We recognise that every individual is different and aim to create suitable arrangements in response to individual circumstances. Homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying are not tolerated.

October 2024 December 2024 February 2025 Renewable Futures We are working to reduce our direct impact on the environment by making physical improvements to the estate. For new building projects we are incorporating renewable technologies where possible including solar PV panels, EV charging points and Air Source Heat Pumps. To improve the energy performance of our historic buildings, we are installing a new Building Management System alongside improved insulation and efficient heating and electrical equipment. Inspiring T omorrow’s Leaders Sustainable learning and engagement opportunities are embedded in our educational, co-curricular and community volunteering activities across College and The Prep. Our College Sustainability Prefects are driving initiatives, communication campaigns and help to provide more opportunities for pupils to become involved in sustainability activities, helping to foster behaviour change across our site. Our Sustainability Working Group advances projects across all aspects of school life and operations, with a particular emphasis on integrating these initiatives with academic subjects and placing our pupils at the centre of these efforts. A Circular Movement Our aim is to use resources considerately and efficiently by reducing our consumption of disposable products , extending the life of items such as old uniforms which can be re-used or re- purposed, and providing effective recycling facilities across the site. Giving Back to Nature We are continually working to make our operations more sustainable by evolving our policies and processes.

This scheme reflects our commitment to energy efficiency, as we have conducted detailed site audits and data analysis in collaboration with our Lead Assessor. These detailed assessments not only meet the latest regulatory standards but also highlight our ongoing dedication to operational excellence and sustainability. We look forward to actively implementing the recommended improvements to guide our energy management strategy and practices. \" New recycling infrastructure The implementation of new recycling facilities across The Prep and College has been highly successful, with a specific emphasis on our boarding houses. The newly installed recycling stations are strategically placed to enhance accessibility and efficiency, allowing our pupils and staff to easily separate and correctly dispose of materials. This upgrade not only supports Zero-Waste-to-Landfill but also fosters a culture of sustainability within our community. Notably, the integration of these facilities has led to a 19% increase in recyclable waste in Leconfield, rising from 35% in 2022 to 54.3% in 2023. \" Reusables As we continue to reduce our use of disposables, we have introduced reusable water bottles and coffee cups available to purchase from College Coffee. These eco-friendly alternatives, sourced from companies dedicated to sustainability, are designed to reduce single-use plastic waste. By providing our pupils and staff with high-quality, reusable options, we are not only minimising our ecological footprint but also supporting brands that align with our values of ethical and sustainable practices.

Whilst the Sustainability Strategy outlines our broad vision, fundamental principles and long-term goals, this Action Plan provides a detailed scope of our short and medium-term objectives and the specific actions agreed for the 2024-2025 Academic Year. It has been specifically developed with participation from the Sustainability Working Group (SWG), which includes representatives from The Prep and College staff, as well as the Senior School Sustainability Prefect. Action Areas of Work – Objectives and Priority Actions Our primary objective for this year will be to build on the successful sustainability projects and direct actions implemented during the 2023-2024 Academic Year. We will continue to ensure that sustainability projects have a positive effect on our school community by embedding sustainability into the school's operations and scaling successful initiatives. Additionally, we will advance several of our key long-term initiatives, with a particular emphasis on waste management and energy reduction. A crucial aspect of our efforts will be advancing our data collection and analysis processes for energy management, allowing us to make more informed decisions and track progress effectively. We will maintain our focus on the significance of educational and engagement initiatives for our students, while also communicating our values and progress to all stakeholders including staff, pupils, parents and the local community. Considering these objectives, the following priority actions have been identified for this Academic Year: Operational Projects • Complete our Energy Saving Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) Phase III Action Plan and utilise it to guide our Energy Management Strategy. • Improve our processes for energy data collection and analysis to more effectively monitor energy consumption. • Continue the implementation of our new recycling and waste management systems across Boarding Houses and Office spaces. • Capture and share the key biodiversity and ecological features of our gardens, with a focus on the Prep Lake, to foster a deeper connection with, and appreciation for, the natural environment. • Support and collaborate with our Catering partner in their initiatives to reduce food waste and capture the carbon footprint of menu items.

There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all (very high confidence).”1 It is therefore clear the imperative need for immediate and substantial action to confront the climate crisis. The UK Government is actively implementing legislative and strategic measures aimed at reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, minimising waste, enhancing air quality, and improving biodiversity and resource efficiency. These initiatives align with the broader objectives outlined in the 25 Year Environment Plan and the Net Zero Strategy. Within this framework, the education sector is required to play its role in positively responding to climate change. As a prestigious institution and prominent local landowner and employer, Cheltenham College is well-positioned to take a leading role in advancing sustainability efforts. We must address the increasing expectations of our stakeholders by mitigating the environmental impact of our operational activities. Achieving these goals will be challenging, and therefore a strategic and well-considered approach is essential to facilitate immediate actions and ensure robust long-term planning. With a community of over 1,100 pupils and 600 staff across The Prep and College, Cheltenham College has a significant responsibility and unique opportunity to shape future generations into proactive agents of change. By embedding sustainability into our educational and extra-curricular activities, we can provide students with valuable learning experiences whilst equipping them with the skills and knowledge necessary to make a meaningful impact in their future endeavours. This approach aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), which emphasise the importance of quality education, climate action, and sustainable practices. Purpose This strategy builds upon the previous iteration of the Cheltenham College Environmental Sustainability Strategy and offers a holistic overview of our strategic sustainability vision and objectives across key areas of work. It is designed to guide internal decision-making and to effectively communicate our commitments to our school community. The strategy considers the interconnected environmental, social, and economic dimensions of sustainability, and seeks to adopt an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approach. It recognises that sustainability is a multifaceted concept with implications for all aspects of our community and operational processes. 1 IPCC, 2023: Section 6 In: Climate Change 2023: Synthesis Report. Contribution of Working Groups I, II and III to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Core Writing Team, H. Lee and J. Romero (eds.)]. IPCC, Geneva, Switzerland, pp. 42 - 66 Scope This strategy encompasses both Cheltenham College Senior School and Cheltenham College Preparatory School, collectively referred to in this document as 'Cheltenham College.' It has been informed by pupils and staff and is embraced by the entire College community, who share collective responsibility for determining and implementing our strategic sustainability vision. The strategy was first approved by Council in June 2022 and is subject to annual review. Administrative responsibility for the strategy lies with the Cheltenham College Sustainability Lead. Strategic Vision Cheltenham College is committed to making a positive contribution to our environment and society by continually improving our sustainability performance and by educating, supporting and inspiring our community to achieve collective impactful change.

It has been fantastic to start to see the tangible positive effects of our direct action, achieved not only through operational improvements but equally by increasing education and engagement opportunities for our community. We are delighted to have made progress in many areas against our Climate Action Plan, as detailed in the following pages. Renewable Futures Working to reduce our direct impact on the environment through physical changes to our estate and operational improvements Highlights and progress: o Our Energy Management Committee continues to bring together key stakeholders to actively and responsibly manage our energy consumption and procurement. As well as scrutinising our consumption data and identifying optimal opportunities for intervention, the Committee provides a forum for capturing sustainability initiatives within our works programme and making transparent the decision-making processes behind these. o A new Building Management System has been installed across the site which now allows us to remotely control our heating systems on a granular level for each building. This is a significant step forwards from a more manual process which we have historically relied on, and will help us to minimise energy wastage, particularly over the holiday periods. o New sub-meters have been installed in a number of Boarding Houses to allow us to accurately track gas and electricity consumption on a building-by-building basis. We have begun to capture this baseline data so that it can be used from January 2025 to help drive meaningful behaviour change through inter-house competitions and engagement events. o A significant focus this year has been on the completion of our mandatory ESOS submission (Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme), which has involved data analysis and site audits to report on our energy consumption over the Phase III period. We have taken an active role in this process, working alongside our Lead Assessor, to really engage with our own data so that we can actively use this going forwards to implement some of the suggested opportunities for improvement, such as voltage optimisation and insulation projects. o Over the past year, Cheltenham College has been involved in the Active Businesses Gloucestershire network, allowing us to learn about and contribute to local initiatives in support of active and sustainable travel. Next steps: Þ Rolling out the installation of automated smart-metering, to improve the accuracy and regularity of how we capture our energy consumption data. Þ Pursuing opportunities for the installation of Solar PV on or near our Sports Centre, to provide renewable energy to this high-use building. Þ Beginning to review requirements for the renewal of our energy contract in 2026, including scrutiny of suppliers’ sustainability credentials. Þ Following our final ESOS submission, creating our ESOS Action Plan and meeting further compliance requirements for progress updates. Þ Instigating pupil-led behaviour change initiatives for energy reduction. Giving Back to Nature Evolving our policies and practices towards a sustainable model which celebrates, nurtures and protects our beautiful gardens and grounds Highlights and progress: o Bird boxes which have been specifically designed to support hole-nesting birds have been installed across College at each of our Boarding Houses, to help attract wildlife to our urban site. We have also begun a project to roll-out specific swift nesting houses at key locations across College and The Prep to provide a vital habitat for this declining species. o At the outdoor classroom area of The Prep we also have some new homemade habitat boxes, crafted from trees felled from College's own land, housing various creatures from bats and owls to birds and insects. o Our Gardens team have chosen a few strategic areas to manage as low-nutrient input lawns. This means that they are cut on a less frequent rotation and use no fertilisers or chemical weeding to allow the plants a chance to flower and set seed, in turn benefitting invertebrates. For example, the lawn between Senior Science and Languages has been overseeded with a low growing mix"}

For example, the lawn between Senior Science and Languages has been overseeded with a low growing mix of flowering native plants including ox eye daisy, birdsfoot trefoil and red fescue. o We are delighted to see our Rain Garden at the Sports Centre in bloom this Summer, following its construction and planting last year with the help of the Prep Sustainability Super Squad. The new water storage and distribution system allows us to harvest rainwater directly from the building’s roof, helping to reduce our consumption of this vital resource. The sensory planting scheme has been designed to provide a habitat for varied wildlife and attract pollinating insects. o At College, the Prefect team were responsible for instigating a sustainable remembrance poppy project. The used poppy badges, crafted from wildflower seed paper, have been planted along the boundary on Sandford Road. When they bloom in the years to come, they will provide a spectacular display of colour and help to create a biodiversity highway through our urban site. Next steps: Þ Identifying further sites for the installation of rainwater capture and irrigation systems across College and The Prep. Þ Providing further opportunities for pupils to get involved in creating and maintaining green spaces around the site, through curricular and co-curricular activities. Þ Continuing to adapt our operational policies and practices towards a more sustainable model. Þ Collaboration with others as a stakeholder for the Science Garden Redevelopment project. A Circular Movement Using resources considerately and effectively to meet our present and future needs, whilst reducing our impact on the environment Highlights and progress: o As we continue to reduce our use of disposables, we have introduced a new reusable option for cold drinks in College Coffee and switched to bamboo straws. Holroyd Howe have also been increasing the range of homemade cakes on offer, to reduce the volume of bought-in pre-packaged goods. o The roll-out of new recycling facilities in boarding houses continues, with new units in place in Queens and Christowe this year and plans for three further houses in 2024. o We have introduced a new dedicated recycling stream for batteries, with new receptacles at both Senior and The Prep, which will bring both environmental and safety benefits. o This year, College has partnered with the social enterprise British Book Rescue to donate 40 boxes of books that were no longer needed here, which will now be given a new home. These books may support education and spark a love of reading in other institutions around the world including schools and prisons, where books may otherwise be inaccessible. Others may be used to raise funds to support the work of charities. o Last Summer a group of College pupils gathered a total of 300kg of unused Cheltenham College and Cheltenham Prep sports kit. Rather than being disposed of, these items were sent to the Mango Tree Charity in Tanzania and Kenya so that they can continue to have a useful life. Next steps: Þ Continuing the roll-out of our new recycling infrastructure across College boarding houses, and extending to classrooms and common spaces. Þ Continuing to reduce our use of disposable products in our catering outlets, particularly looking at takeaway containers in Valens in conjunction with refurbishment of this space. Þ Implementing a ‘Reduce, Reuse, Recycle’ scheme to ensure that we are extending the life of everyday products used throughout College and The Prep, such as stationery, furniture and old uniform. Þ Identifying further steps to reduce paper usage in teaching and learning environments. Inspiring Tomorrow’s Leaders Embedding sustainable learning and engagement opportunities in everything we do, raising awareness and fostering lasting behaviour change Highlights and progress: o This year we have been delighted to work"}

Þ Identifying further steps to reduce paper usage in teaching and learning environments. Inspiring Tomorrow’s Leaders Embedding sustainable learning and engagement opportunities in everything we do, raising awareness and fostering lasting behaviour change Highlights and progress: o This year we have been delighted to work with our newly appointed Sustainability Prefects at College to develop a range of education and engagement initiatives which are peer-led. A highlight was our speaker event with Hugh Pearson of Oceanic Films, a marine biologist and wildlife filmmaker. The event was organised by Ella, one of our Prefects. It was fascinating to hear from Hugh about his career journey and to get a behind-the-scenes look at the production of some of our favourite blockbuster series including The Blue Planet and Africa. It was also important to hear Hugh's first-hand experience of how our oceans are changing due to the impact of climate change and human activity, and the challenges facing the future health of our seas. o There have been over 1500 page views from Cheltenham College pupils and staff of the Resurgence & Ecologist online publication over 2023, which we subscribed to last year, and this has now been renewed for 2024. The educational magazine addresses a range of environmental and social challenges and opportunities, from the future of food to ethical fashion. o Our Sustainability Newsletter continues to be very well received by pupils and staff, providing updates on initiatives alongside relevant global news. Next steps: Þ Continuing to utilise the Sustainability Working Group to drive forward projects in all areas of school life and operations, with a particular focus on tying in with academic subjects. Þ Working with our next College Sustainability Prefect to provide more opportunities for pupils to become involved in sustainability activities, developing a network of sustainability champions across the Boarding Houses. Þ Establishing a schedule of sustainability practices that each pupil can implement daily during the school day. Þ Working closely with our Marketing Team to ensure that we are effectively communicating our objectives and sharing positive progress. Þ Exploring partnership opportunities for pupils to become involved in local collaborative educational and activities and networks For any further information, or to get involved in our sustainability work, please contact us on sustainability@cheltenhamcollege.org"}

The process consists of two parts: An inspection of educational quality A regulatory compliance inspection From The Head I am delighted to be able to share the outcome of our recent inspection by the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI). This was a full inspection of both regulatory compliance and a judgement of the quality of education we provide in terms of pupil achievement (academic and other) including pupils’ personal development. College was judged to be fully compliant and Excellent, the highest rating, in every area. We were delighted to read the detailed comments included in this Executive Summary, which externally and rigorously validated the hard work and dedication of the staff and the fantastic attitude of the pupils that I see on a daily basis. We were also thrilled that the application of ICT across all subjects by both pupils and teachers was deemed to be outstanding, which is a testament to the major focus we have had, post COVID-19, in making the most of the new digital skills we have all learned. We look forward to building on this in the future. It was also recognised by the ISI team that our “passionate teachers and highly supportive house staff ensure every pupil achieves their potential and beyond.” We are incredibly proud of this outcome and comments provided. Best wishes Nicola Huggett, Head Cheltenham College CHELTENHAM COLLEGE | ISI EXECUTIVE SUMMARY3The quality of the pupils’ academic and other achievements is excellent. • Pupils make excellent progress in developing a wide range of knowledge, skills and understanding. • Pupils are excellent communicators; in particular they are articulate and expressive speakers and respectful listeners. • Pupils’ application of information and communications technology (ICT) skills across all subjects is outstanding. • Pupils’ achievements beyond the classroom are wide-ranging and sometimes at the very highest level. • Pupils’ attitudes to learning are excellent. “The school wholeheartedly fulfils its aim to equip pupils to lead purposeful and fulfilling lives by providing an excellent all-round education.” “Pupils’ strong academic progress, both within lessons and over time, is clearly evident in their academic outcomes. “ “The majority of pupils gain entry to their first-choice universities at a wide rang of institutions in the UK, USA and Canada to study a broad range of subjects.” “Pupils develop an excellent range of knowledge, skills and understanding across a broad range of subjects. This is as a result of well scaffolded and differentiated teaching.” Pupils in Year 13 (Upper Sixth) ably applied the principles of Lenz’s law in Physics to determine the induction of a wire’s current by an oscillating magnetic field. Music is of pivotal importance to school life. Pupils perform in a range of choirs, orchestras and other instrumental ensembles and their singing en masse in chapel is extraordinarily robust. Pupils in Year 10 (Fourth Form) extended their English vocabulary to describe techniques in poetry such as metaphor, caesura, ellipsis and onomatopoeia when analysing Carol Ann Duffy’s love poetry. Pupils of all ages are able to develop their dramatic skills through their participation in one or more of the seven annual productions, including a performance in a local professional theatre and major productions involving nearly 100 pupils, for example the recent success, Grease. Through their endeavours, pupils develop a greater awareness of the wider socioeconomic society and understand the important contribution they can make. Successful fulfilment of the school’s aims are exemplified in the pupils’ development of skills for a modern world and a commitment to the service of others. Pupils listen extremely attentively to their teachers and peers whilst in lessons and discussions, and are exemplary in their active and supportive appreciation of their peers. Pupils exhibit notably advanced research skills enabling them to demonstrate secure ownership of their own learning. Pupils develop excellent communication skills throughout the school. They relish regular opportunities to discuss and debate in lessons. Two-thirds of pupils participate in the school’s well-established community projects, including The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award (DofE) scheme, and a third"}

The range of these Regulations can be viewed on the website www.legislation.gov.uk. Additionally, inspections will consider the school’s accessibility plan under Schedule 10 of the Equality Act 2010 and the ban on corporal punishment introduced by the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. This inspection report follows the ISI schedule. The inspection on which the report is based took place over a period of four continuous days in the school. The previous ISI boarding intermediate inspection was in May 2014, the previous ISI interim inspection was in September 2010 and the previous ISI second cycle inspection was in October 2006. The inspection was also carried out under the arrangements of the ISC Associations for the maintenance and improvement of the quality of their membership. This inspection contains specific judgements on the National Minimum Standards for Boarding Schools. It comments on the progress made by the school in meeting the recommendations set out in the most recent statutory boarding inspection and evaluates the quality of the boarding experience and its contribution to pupils’ education, personal development and welfare. The inspection of the school is from an educational perspective and provides limited inspection of other aspects, although inspectors comment on any significant hazards or problems they encounter which have an adverse impact on children. The inspection does not include: (i)an exhaustive health and safety audit; (ii)an in-depth examination of the structural condition of the school, its services or other physical features; (iii)an investigation of the financial viability of the school or its accounting procedures; (iv)an in-depth investigation of the school’s compliance with employment law. Inspectors may be aware of individual safeguarding concerns, allegations and complaints as part of the inspection process. Such matters will not usually be referred to in the published report but will have been considered by the team in reaching their judgements. Both Ofsted and ISI inspect and report on the Independent School Standards Regulations. However, they apply different frameworks and have different criteria for judging school quality that are suited to the different types of schools they inspect. Both use a four point scale when making judgements of quality but, whilst the ISI terminology reflects quality judgements that are at least equivalent to those used by Ofsted, they also reflect the differences in approach. ISI reports do not provide a single overarching judgement for the school but instead give a clear judgement on each aspect of the school’s work at the beginning of each section. These headline statements must include one of the ISI descriptors ‘excellent’, ‘good’, ‘sound’ or ‘unsatisfactory’, and where Achievement is ‘exceptional’ that term may be used for the top grade. Elsewhere in the report, inspectors may use a range of different adjectives to make judgements. For EYFS registered provision (for children aged under two), reports are required to use the same terminology (‘outstanding’, ‘good’, ‘requires improvement’ and ‘inadequate’) as Ofsted reports. Independent Schools Inspectorate 2016INSPECTION EVIDENCE The inspectors observed lessons, conducted formal interviews with pupils and examined samples of pupils’ work.

THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SCHOOL 1.1 Cheltenham College is a co-educational selective independent boarding and day school for pupils between the ages of 13 and 18. It has many buildings dating from the Victorian period and is situated in extensive grounds near the centre of Cheltenham. It was established in 1841 as a school for boys, founded on Christian principles; girls were admitted into the sixth form in 1981 and the school became fully co-educational in 1998. The school has 653 pupils on roll, comprising 383 boys and 270 girls. About four-fifths of pupils are boarders. There are eight boarding houses, three for girls and five for boys, each house providing for the full age range of the senior school. In addition there are two day houses, one for girls and one for boys, providing a pastoral, social and study base. 1.2 The overall aim of the school is to equip pupils to lead fulfilled and purposeful lives by providing an excellent all-round education, founded on Christian principles. In order to do this, the school seeks to foster in pupils intellectual curiosity, academic rigour and the ability to learn independently. Additionally, it aims to develop: talents and interests beyond the academic; the knowledge, skills and attitudes to succeed in a complex, fast-changing, multi-cultural society, with compassion, sound judgement and integrity; spiritual, moral and aesthetic awareness; commitment to the service of others; and a readiness to contribute to the common good, with respect for people and the environment. 1.3 The governing body of the school is known as the Council; its members are trustees and its chair is the president. The headmaster of the college has overall responsibility for the preparatory and senior schools. The senior leadership team of the senior school has expanded since the previous inspection, with the introduction of three assistant heads responsible for learning and well-being, for co-curricular activities and for academic matters, to complement the headmaster, as well as the bursar, second master, director of admissions and marketing, and deputy head responsible for pastoral matters. 1.4 Day pupils come from families living in Cheltenham and surrounding Cotswold towns and villages.

Most pupils come from families who are economically advantaged, but a substantial proportion receive assistance through the school’s scholarships and bursaries. About a third of the pupils come from the preparatory school, originally opened in 1865. The remaining two-thirds come from local preparatory and secondary schools, or from overseas; a considerable number join the school at the start of the sixth form. Approximately one-sixth of pupils come from other countries, and most pupils are of white British ethnicity. 1.5 The ability profile of the school, as measured by a standardised national test, is above the national average, but illustrates a considerable spread of ability. The school has 139 pupils who come from families who speak English as an additional language (EAL), and 114 of these receive specialist English support. A total of 60 pupils have been identified with special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND), of whom 27 are receiving specialist learning support, mainly related to dyslexia. No pupil has an education, health and care plan or a statement of special educational needs.

THE SUCCESS OF THE SCHOOL 2.(a) Main findings 2.1 Cheltenham College is very successful in meeting its aim of equipping pupils to lead fulfilled and purposeful lives by providing an excellent all-round education. Pupils are receptive and attentive learners who enjoy the challenges of independent learning, which is promoted rigorously. Results in public examinations are similar to the national average for maintained selective schools and pupils’ extra-curricular achievements are excellent. The tracking and monitoring of pupil progress are well developed, and purposeful interventions take place very effectively to maintain pupils’ progress. Staff use information and communication technology (ICT) effectively in lessons; however, pupils are not always given the opportunities to fully utilise ICT to support their learning. Extra-curricular success is encouraged by the strong commitment of all staff to promoting excellence in all areas of school life. Pupils’ high academic achievement is supported by excellent teaching. New approaches to teaching are encouraged and, as a result, a range of novel approaches creates interest and engagement for pupils. The curriculum and extra- curricular programme are excellent, having both balance and real breadth throughout the school, including the sixth form. 2.2 Pupils’ personal development is excellent. Pupils are enthusiastic about their school life and speak warmly about relationships, in terms of both their peers and staff. Their boarding experience is outstanding, particularly through the high quality pastoral care and also the support and guidance they receive through the house system. Day pupils are fulsome in their praise of the house system and feel wholly involved in the life of the school. Pupils are compassionate young people, committed to the needs of those less fortunate than themselves. Pupils who responded to the questionnaire were very positive about their academic progress, the wide range of extra-curricular activities and all aspects of their boarding experience. They were less satisfied with the quality of food, the consistency of the awarding of rewards and sanctions, and how their voice is listened to and acted upon. Inspection evidence did not support their view on the quality of food or on sanctions. Inspection found some differences across the school with opportunities for rewards, and that while"}

Inspection evidence did not support their view on the quality of food or on sanctions. Inspection found some differences across the school with opportunities for rewards, and that while pupils’ views are heard and acted upon, the outcomes of discussions are not comprehensively communicated. 2.3 Governance is excellent and provides astute strategic guidance to the executive of the school, alongside rigorous oversight in its monitoring role. Leadership and management are excellent. The excellent progress made by the school since the last inspection is reflected in the successful implementation of a large number of changes, with a particular focus on pupils’ welfare, including the appointment of new senior staff, the expansion of the curriculum and the increased emphasis on good classroom practice. The school has an excellent relationship with its parents, demonstrated in their very strong responses to the questionnaire. The overwhelming majority are very pleased with all aspects of school life and, most particularly, the boarding experience. Cheltenham College 4 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 20162.(b) Action points (i)Compliance with regulatory requirements 2.4 The school meets all the requirements of the Education (Independent School Standards) Regulations 2014. 2.5 The school meets all the National Minimum Standards for Boarding Schools 2015. (ii)Recommendations for further improvement 2.6 The school is advised to make the following improvements. 1.Develop more effective communication strategies for explaining to pupils the outcomes of the school committees’ deliberations. 2.Extend pupils’ use of ICT through the curriculum to promote learning. 3.Implement an appropriate rewards system for senior pupils in the school. Cheltenham College 5 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 20163. THE QUALITY OF ACADEMIC AND OTHER ACHIEVEMENTS 3.(a) The quality of the pupils’ achievements and learning 3.1 The quality of pupils’ achievements and learning is excellent. 3.2 Pupils are well educated, their achievements and learning being very much in line with the school’s aim to foster intellectual curiosity and independence in learning, as well as to enrich their talents and interests. Pupils are articulate and curious, keen to embrace the opportunities provided, and rise to the challenges set by dedicated teachers, for example through the independent study opportunities provided by the extended project in the sixth form. Reading and writing are well developed across the curriculum. Independent thinking is particularly evident in the sixth form in the humanities, where a questioning approach based on lively debate is both encouraged and expected. Numeracy skills and logical thought are well grounded in Years 9 to 11 through mathematics and science in particular, with an emphasis placed on securing rigorous foundations through accurate application of techniques. When opportunities arise, ICT is used skilfully. 3.3 The pupils’ achievement in extra-curricular activities is excellent, and is wide ranging in scope. Many pupils pursue sport at regional or national standard; teams compete successfully locally and internationally, with opportunities to represent the school provided at all levels of ability. Talented individuals are encouraged and helped in pursuing regional and international honours. Excellent achievement in the performing arts is exemplified by the high number of music and drama awards, the high quality of the orchestras and choirs, and well-received performances at, for example, the Cheltenham Festival. The Combined Cadet Force (CCF) and The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award scheme are both popular, and pupils successfully aspire to positions of responsibility, both through activities and within the school generally. 3.4 The following analysis uses the national data for 2012 to 2014, the most recent three-year period for which comparative statistics are currently available. Results in GCSE examinations are above the national average for maintained schools, and similar to the national average for maintained selective schools. Since 2012 just under 60 per cent of grades awarded were A* or A. International GCSE results have been higher than worldwide norms overall. At A level, results are above the national average for maintained"}

Since 2012 just under 60 per cent of grades awarded were A* or A. International GCSE results have been higher than worldwide norms overall. At A level, results are above the national average for maintained selective schools. These levels of attainment, standardised measures of progress and inspection evidence indicate that pupils make progress that is high overall in relation to the average for pupils of similar abilities. There is no significant gender imbalance in results at either A level or GCSE. Most pupils proceed to university each year. 3.5 Pupils with SEND or EAL respond well to the wide range of interventions and support strategies available, both academic and pastoral, which are designed both to help them succeed in the classroom and integrate into the school community. Monitoring of their academic performance is regular and pays close attention to their particular needs. Advice to staff is bespoke and well tailored, and disseminated through regular updates. Training is given to staff to help them understand and manage particular needs. Examination results are separately analysed for pupils with SEND or EAL, and outcomes are at least in line with those of other pupils. 3.6 Pupils greatly appreciate all that is on offer at the school, and have a very positive attitude towards all that they undertake. They respond well to a range of lesson approaches, quickly settling to their tasks with little wasted time, and take advantage Cheltenham College 6 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2016of help available outside class. Independent work, for example, collaborative experimental measurement of critical angles in physics and mind mapping in economics, is well developed. Pupils exhibit a passion for their subject and bring imagination and energy to their studies; for example, Year 9 pupils used dice and room-crossing bunting streamers to expand the variety and complexity of language use in a Spanish lesson. Pupils talk of their busy lives with pride, keen to demonstrate that they can balance the competing demands of study and play. In this they succeed: their ability to manage their time is excellent, supported as they are by the strong pastoral care and advice on offer. The school’s stated aim to foster the attitudes to succeed in a complex society is well met. 3.(b) The contribution of curricular and extra-curricular provision 3.7 The contribution of curricular and extra-curricular provision is excellent. 3.8 The curriculum is broad and balanced and offers a wide range of subjects, suitable for the age and ability of the pupils. It facilitates the attainment of high standards of subject knowledge, understanding and skills, while fulfilling the school’s aims of promoting intellectual curiosity and independent learning. Extensive provision is included for all elements of the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect, along with a balanced presentation of opposing views in the coverage of political issues in both curricular and extra- curricular activities. 3.9 In Year 9 the curriculum includes a range of modern foreign languages, along with classical civilisation and Latin. The provision for public examinations has recently been enhanced by the addition of classical civilisation at GCSE and Greek at both GCSE and A level, and of psychology at A level. Sciences are taught as separate subjects and ICT is taught within curriculum subjects. Provision for the creative subjects is excellent, with facilities that are well suited to developing technical skills and originality, while artists and directors in residence offer practical advice and inspiration to the pupils. Since the previous inspection, headmaster’s research projects have been introduced in Years 9 and 11, and there is a compulsory independent project in Year 12 which provides excellent opportunities for self- regulated independent learning. 3.10 Pupils’ personal development is enriched by a comprehensive personal, social, health and citizenship education (PSHCE) programme, focused closely on the needs of specific age"}

This is enhanced by the well-being programme, which encourages pupils to support each other and to view challenges and setbacks as positive opportunities for personal and academic development. An extensive and well-resourced careers programme uses an online occupational analysis scheme to assist pupils in making informed choices at each stage of their education. 3.11 Talented and more able pupils are catered for using extension work in regular lessons and are supported further by regular self-selected activities within an academic enhancement programme of events after school. Talented pupils in the arts and sport are provided with excellent opportunities to develop their strengths. The talented athlete and scholarship programmes provide significant challenge for the most able and, supported by a network of professionals and experts, these pupils are keen to act as ambassadors and role models to others in their own areas of expertise. Pupils with SEND or EAL are given excellent support by a specialist department and through curricular planning across all subject areas, which ensures Cheltenham College 7 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2016that their needs are well catered for in regular lessons. They have access to the full curriculum, including a foreign language in the majority of cases, and learning support provision was seen as a strong area by parents and pupils in their responses to questionnaires. The curriculum is adapted to their needs, with a reduced GCSE programme if appropriate, to ensure that they have time to develop their understanding effectively in core areas. 3.12 Pupils benefit from a far-reaching extra-curricular programme, which incorporates sport, the arts, practical activity and community service. These represent excellent opportunities for pupils to find areas that motivate them, to challenge themselves and to offer service to the wider community. The sporting programme offers a vast choice of competitive team and individual sports, including rowing, rackets, shooting and golf. A wide range of additional activities is available, including house choral competitions, drama productions, sculpting and public speaking, alongside business and charity ventures. Many such activities are offered through societies, including a travel award programme which offers grants to Year 12 pupils, following a rigorous application process. The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award scheme, the CCF and the Third Form Challenge are popular, offering excellent opportunities for personal growth. Further enrichment in many areas is provided through trips, visits and expeditions, activities about which parents’ questionnaire responses were overwhelmingly positive. 3.(c) The contribution of teaching 3.13 The contribution of teaching is excellent. 3.14 The teaching helps the school to realise its aim to foster intellectual curiosity, academic rigour and the ability to learn independently. At its best it encourages passionate discussion and rigorous debate, and otherwise rarely fails to deliver highly structured learning in a calm and productive atmosphere of co-operation. Pupils’ behaviour is, as a result, almost always excellent, and discipline in class is maintained with a very light touch. 3.15 Teachers demonstrate good, and often excellent, subject knowledge. Lessons are carefully prepared, imaginative and well structured. Humour and the encouragement of peer support and constant self-reflection feature frequently. Questioning is suitably focused to allow all to contribute; for example in a Year 13 art history lesson, the most able pupils were asked to offer multiple observations rather than being satisfied with one. Skilful use of ICT enhances learning in some lessons, notably in English, modern foreign languages (for example, web-based classrooms) and chemistry. However its use as a teaching resource is uneven across subjects. Relationships between pupils and staff are excellent and contribute to the positive atmosphere of shared endeavour in lessons. 3.16 In the best lessons,"}

However its use as a teaching resource is uneven across subjects. Relationships between pupils and staff are excellent and contribute to the positive atmosphere of shared endeavour in lessons. 3.16 In the best lessons, pupils have plentiful opportunity to work independently and learn from each other, guided by the teacher. A very small number of lessons observed concentrated on the acquisition of rote techniques, offering insufficient opportunity to investigate the underlying theory. 3.17 Both class work and homework are well presented, and marking is regular and usually thorough; where there is more detailed feedback, it shows pupils what has gone well and what could be improved. This has addressed recommendations from the previous inspection. Pupils frequently appraise their own work and set appropriate targets for improvement; for example, in biology, internal tests have a Cheltenham College 8 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2016formal process of dialogue between teacher and pupil, focused on the pupil’s self- review. Homework is set regularly and, in most cases, offers pupils the chance to develop the work undertaken in class rather than to simply reinforce it. 3.18 Since the previous inspection, the school has invested considerably in professional development for teachers, supported by peer observation and staff ‘learning lunches’ to enable the sharing of good practice. Teachers’ understanding of how to support pupils with SEND or EAL has benefited from regular in-service training, and guidance from the learning support department. 3.19 Excellent monitoring of teaching and learning ensures that provision for the talented and more able is a priority for all academic staff; for example, art scholars benefit from studying with older pupils to develop advanced skills and understanding. Whole-school assessment is highly detailed, regular and comprehensive, and supports the work of teachers well. Pupils know that their progress is closely monitored, and the information shared effectively. Any academic concerns are quickly addressed, reflecting improvements since the previous inspection. Both pupils and their parents appreciate the support that teachers provide. 3.20 Teachers offer considerable additional support to pupils outside classes, both individually and in small groups or clinics. Pupils’ responses to questionnaires and in discussions during the inspection showed their appreciation for their teachers’ support. All teaching promotes the values of tolerance and respect, and the appreciation of other faiths and cultures. Teaching is non-partisan in the coverage of political issues. Cheltenham College 9 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 20164. THE QUALITY OF THE PUPILS’ PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT 4.(a) The spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of the pupils 4.1 The spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of the pupils is excellent. 4.2 Throughout their time in the school, pupils develop a strong understanding of personal responsibility, fully in line with the school’s aim to develop high levels of self-esteem and the confidence to be adaptable and tolerant. Pupils achieve an excellent level of personal spiritual development. Christian values are pivotal to the ethos of the school and pupils benefit from regular worship in the school chapel, itself architecturally inspiring, where they take an active part in music, readings and prayers, and where all faiths or none are respected. The chapel acts as a focus for a keen sense of humanity and tolerance. Pupils further benefit from regular chaplaincy visits to houses. They are self-aware and respectful of each other. They fully appreciate non-material aspects of life. 4.3 Pupils develop a strong moral sense. They understand the difference between right and wrong, and benefit greatly from the strong set of core values which the school presents as a practical code to enhance life within and beyond its community. Pupils have good opportunities to discuss and reflect upon moral and ethical issues. They understand and respect the civil and criminal law of England. Older pupils lead by example; they often help younger pupils as they progress through the school. Pupils value relationships, and"}

Pupils have good opportunities to discuss and reflect upon moral and ethical issues. They understand and respect the civil and criminal law of England. Older pupils lead by example; they often help younger pupils as they progress through the school. Pupils value relationships, and they treat both each other and members of staff with respect. Pupils feel secure in their relationships and know where to seek guidance and support if required. They feel that there is always a ‘listening ear’ available. Pupils show exceptional maturity, confidence, articulacy and openness, both around the school and in discussions. They support a range of house and school charitable activities, including cycle rides and treks linked to good causes, and weekly collections in chapel. 4.4 The social development of pupils is excellent. They have a very strong and well- expressed view of their school as a vibrant and supportive community and of its place in the wider world. Pupils have a broad general knowledge of the public institutions and services of England. They have good and developing links with the town and the wider community. Leadership is an active and key concept that runs through the school and its houses; it is reiterated in lessons and other activities, including the CCF, extra-curricular pursuits, games, clubs and societies. Pupils benefit from opportunities to show leadership, whether through the house system or as mentors to younger pupils. Older pupils particularly see the latter as an important role. Questionnaire responses, however, showed that a small minority of pupils felt that they do not have the opportunity to take on positions of responsibility. Inspection evidence showed that prefects are a key part of the school’s success and that pupils appreciate their status and guidance by example. 4.5 Cultural awareness is strong and evident across the school. There is a secure awareness of and respect for a range of cultural traditions. Pupils gain understanding of other cultures through the curriculum and also through educational and sporting trips at home and abroad. International pupils are welcomed and integrated into the school’s everyday life. All pupils appreciate the range and variety of artistic, musical and dramatic opportunities on offer, both within and outside the school. Pupils have a secure understanding of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and British institutions, civic and political, reinforced by the PSHCE programme. They appreciate the virtues of democracy, human rights, tolerance and Cheltenham College 10 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2016other such values, respecting other people, particularly those with characteristics protected by the Equality Act 2010, and they understand the importance of identifying and combating discrimination. Pupils also have a good understanding of political and economic issues, and they debate and discuss such ideas intelligently. They are confident, respectful and reflective, with a strong social awareness and an evident appreciation of the wider world. The shared values of the pupils are a strong and unifying feature of the school. They assume a personal responsibility for ensuring that their school is a friendly and happy place, so that, by the time they leave, they have an outstanding level of personal development. 4.(b) The contribution of arrangements for pastoral care 4.6 The contribution of arrangements for pastoral care is excellent. 4.7 Academic and pastoral staff provide a very high standard of support for both boarders and day pupils, in line with the school’s aim, thus creating a climate of tolerance and respect. Pastoral care contributes extremely well to pupils’ personal development. The school’s pastoral arrangements are based on secure policies and procedures, with effective monitoring by senior pastoral management. Houses are allowed to develop their own identity within a whole-school structure. The school is highly successful in promoting good behaviour and guarding against bullying and cyber bullying. When misbehaviour does occur, a range of appropriate sanctions are imposed and recorded. In response to the questionnaire, a minority of pupils expressed a"}

When misbehaviour does occur, a range of appropriate sanctions are imposed and recorded. In response to the questionnaire, a minority of pupils expressed a view that teachers are inconsistent in the way that sanctions and rewards are given. Inspection evidence showed that this was based on differences across the school rather than ineffective practice. Sanctions and rewards are carefully and effectively monitored by the senior management team, but the school is currently seeking to increase opportunities for giving rewards. 4.8 The quality of relationships between staff and pupils is excellent, as are the relations amongst pupils, with older pupils acting as mentors for the younger ones. There is a mutual respect evident within the house system. Pupils feel well looked after and valued as part of their school community, and the pastoral team knows them very well. 4.9 Pupils are actively encouraged to lead a healthy lifestyle by taking part in the diverse sporting activities available to all. Pupils are also encouraged to eat healthily, and this is taught in PSHCE lessons. 4.10 The school fulfils its duties and has an appropriate policy and plan for pupils with SEND. 4.11 Pupils’ views are regularly sought and the pupils lead a large number of committees. In response to the questionnaire, a minority of pupils did not believe that their opinions are acted upon and that greater clarity about outcomes is sometimes required. Inspection evidence showed that pupils’ views are listened to and regularly acted upon, but that outcomes of committees’ deliberations are not comprehensively communicated. Cheltenham College 11 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 20164.(c) The contribution of arrangements for welfare, health and safety 4.12 The contribution of arrangements for welfare, health and safety is excellent. 4.13 Safeguarding of pupils is central to the school, and its comprehensive policy is implemented most effectively, taking into account all the current official guidance. All members of staff, trustees and volunteers receive regular and highly effective child protection training. All the required recruitment checks have been carried out in an exemplary manner. Excellent induction programmes for new staff ensure that up-to-date information about the school’s procedures is very effectively disseminated. E-safety has been well developed, both from the educational point of view and in the use of appropriate monitoring software. There is a close and fruitful relationship with local agencies, including children’s services when appropriate, and active measures have been taken in preventing radicalisation. Records relating to any concerns about pupils’ welfare are carefully stored. The pupil welfare committee is highly effective in ensuing that pupils’ welfare is of paramount importance in the life of the school. The school has highly developed strategies for supporting pupils’ physical and mental well-being. 4.14 The necessary measures in place to reduce risks from fire and other hazards are extremely thorough, and they are rigorously documented and monitored. Exemplary leadership in this area permeates the culture of the school. Fire risk assessment and training records are up to date, fire drills are held regularly at different times of the day and evacuation procedures are clear. Risk assessments are thorough and detailed, supported by ongoing monitoring and review by an outside agency. The health and safety committee meets regularly, and its recommendations are considered and implemented by the school leadership. A high level of monitoring ensures that the governing body has a full awareness of all issues pertaining to the health and welfare of pupils and takes action where required. 4.15 The suite of first-aid policies provides very clear guidance for the care and welfare of all pupils who are ill or injured, or who have special educational needs and/or disabilities. The new medical provision for pupils is excellent. The majority of members of staff are first-aid trained and their training is updated appropriately. Accidents,"}

The new medical provision for pupils is excellent. The majority of members of staff are first-aid trained and their training is updated appropriately. Accidents, illnesses and provision of medication are recorded rigorously. Registration of the pupils throughout the school takes place effectively and any unexplained absences are followed up quickly. The admission and attendance records are appropriately maintained and correctly stored for the required three-year period. Cheltenham College 12 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 20164.(d) The quality of boarding 4.16 The quality of boarding is excellent. 4.17 Outcomes for boarders are excellent. Boarders are extremely well cared for, in line with the school’s boarding principles. They are articulate, confident and appreciative of boarding at the school and have respect for each other and for the staff. Both staff and boarders say that there is a supportive atmosphere in the houses. The boarders are outstandingly polite and co-operative, and they display tolerance and a caring attitude to each other. They say that the different ages are well integrated within the houses. Vertical ‘families’ of pupils work together very successfully. The boarders’ voice is heard at the committee meetings run by senior boarders and also at Council meetings, with several notable outcomes, such as the renewal of the paving by the chapel. Every house has a suggestions book in which boarders can write, as well as a ‘You might like to know’ box. House masters and house mistresses read and comment regularly on the remarks made. 4.18 Prefects and heads of houses are recruited through selection by both boarders and staff, and receive a comprehensive training programme. They say that they try to manage the other boarders through ‘friendship respect’. Boarders spoken to agree that there is always someone to talk to should they need to do so. All relevant safeguarding and counselling telephone numbers are posted on notice boards and in telephone booths, so that boarders can contact someone outside school should the need arise. There is ample opportunity for boarders to contact their families by telephone and email or through other internet means of communication. 4.19 The quality of boarding provision and care is excellent. New boarders have considerable contact from their houses before arrival; they receive information and have the opportunity to stay in their houses and get to know other new arrivals before the term starts. There are clear induction plans for international, Year 12 and other boarders, which ensure that integration is a smooth process. Day pupils may stay overnight on occasion, and appreciate the ways in which their day house is run like a full boarding house. 4.20 The protocols for the management of sick boarders are excellent. Staff are appropriately qualified and provide 24-hour cover from nurses and matrons. There is a daily doctor’s surgery and the doctor is very involved in all aspects of medical care in the school. Health plans are thorough and circulated as necessary. Handovers at the beginning and end of the day are enabled through an electronic record of any medications given at any time and have successfully addressed the issue raised at the last boarding inspection. 4.21 Accommodation in the houses is well maintained and issues are dealt with through a maintenance staff book, where staff and boarders can enter requests. A check of this and the houses is made daily by the maintenance staff and matron. A majority of boarders said that they do not enjoy the food.

A check of this and the houses is made daily by the maintenance staff and matron. A majority of boarders said that they do not enjoy the food. Inspection evidence showed that the menus are well planned, with ample choice, especially at lunchtime, and that two extra dining spaces with alternative menus are provided. Special diets are catered for and themed nights are frequent and enjoyed. Also in questionnaire responses, a minority of boarders criticised the availability of snacks and drinks. Inspectors found that there is a suitable range of snacks and drinks available in each house. The school uses an efficient outside laundry, though many pupils use the ample facilities in the houses to do their own. The boarders all have the facility to be able to lock away any possessions they may wish to keep safe. Cheltenham College 13 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 20164.22 The wide range of voluntary evening activities is well attended, both during or after prep time. In response to the questionnaires, a minority of boarders said that they do not feel there are enough activities at the weekend. In discussions, boarders’ opinions were very varied. Inspection evidence showed that there is a suitable range of activities available, but no compulsion to take part, so the boarders have a choice as to what they can do. Newspapers are available in the houses every day so that boarders have access to outside events. 4.23 The quality of arrangements for welfare and safeguarding is excellent. There is an appropriate safeguarding policy; staff receive initial training and the necessary updates regularly. Recruitment of boarding staff is carried out as required. All adults who live in boarding accommodation, but are not employed by the school, are appropriately checked, and they have a code of conduct certificate that they sign. In questionnaire responses, a very large majority of boarders said that they feel safe in their boarding house and that they enjoy boarding. The comprehensive behaviour management policy works well across the school, and a very large majority of boarders consider that staff treat them fairly. Behaviour is excellent. Records of minor and more serious misdemeanours are monitored regularly. Bullying is not a concern and boarders know that anything of that nature would be dealt with rapidly and well. Suitable records are kept. The school has appropriate risk assessments for the houses, activities and trips, and fire drills are carried out appropriately. Boarders’ whereabouts are known through the signing out system, and if any boarders are ill at night they know how to access a member of staff. The welfare management team comprises appropriate members and meets fortnightly; after discussion it decides on any actions, which are transmitted to the relevant staff and parents. 4.24 Excellent leadership and management ensure that the school’s boarding aims and principles are fulfilled. The houses are extremely well run, with suitably qualified personnel and adequate staffing levels. Policies and procedures are well implemented. For example, the issue highlighted at the last inspection, of ensuring that logs of disciplinary incidents, including those for bullying, are in a consistent format, are up to date and facilitate an accurate overview, has been fully addressed. The positive atmosphere in the houses ensures that boarders feel that they are supported and results in their efforts to do their best. All the required records and other documents are maintained and monitored appropriately. All staff receive both job descriptions and regular appraisals, and are made aware of external training that is available to them. Matrons and resident staff meet with house masters and house mistresses over a fortnightly lunch and receive informal training covering a number of relevant issues. The system for regular reviews of house structures and practice feeds into a robust development planning cycle. Checks on compliance are carried out in house, peer inspected and followed up by the head of boarding. As all staff except matrons are school tutors, there is substantial information in houses concerning the boarders’ academic progress and well-being, which is used effectively.

In questionnaire responses, parents were overwhelmingly supportive of boarding at the school. Cheltenham College 14 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 20165. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GOVERNANCE, LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT 5.(a) The quality of governance 5.1 The quality of governance is excellent. 5.2 Governance promotes the aims of the school exceptionally well and strongly contributes to school development at all levels. The Council has developed, with the leadership of the school, into a strong cohesive partnership, providing a dynamic group for effecting change. This has taken place through the strategically astute guidance of the Council’s leadership, which provides highly effective and dependable oversight of all sections of the school. Carefully selected trustees are appointed who have appropriate skills, coupled with a commitment to promoting excellence in the school. The training and development of trustees, linked to appropriate succession planning, are strong. Trustees maintain robust oversight of the educational standards, financial planning, and investment in staff, accommodation and resources of the school extremely effectively by drawing up and monitoring a carefully constructed strategic plan. 5.3 The Council contributes strongly to strategic planning. For example, the implementation of a new format for Council meetings, enabling trustees to spend time with staff and pupils, ensures that the trustees gain a first-hand understanding to inform their strategic planning and monitoring role. The new committees’ structure enables well-researched contributions and challenge to school development, and ensures that regulatory functions are satisfied appropriately, whilst promoting good communication between the Council and the school. 5.4 Trustees fulfil their statutory responsibilities effectively, providing rigorous oversight of policies and practice, through the development of the safeguarding trustee role and the annual review of the safeguarding policy. When appropriate, the Council makes excellent use of external professional audits to support the school’s further development. Through their support, policy and practice, the trustees ensure that pupils’ well-being is central to the school’s work. Cheltenham College 15 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 20165.(b) The quality of leadership and management, including links with parents, carers and guardians 5.5 The quality of leadership and management, including links with parents, carers and guardians, is excellent. 5.6 Leadership and management are highly effective and successful in fulfilling the aim of the school to provide an excellent all-round education, with academic rigour at its heart. Senior leadership, which provides strong, clear and well-articulated educational direction for the school, identifies areas for development and strengthens them with a well-expressed clarity of mission and notable drive whilst encouraging respect for others and democracy in the ethos of the school. Management and leadership teams at all levels throughout the school are committed to implementing a clear vision for its development, which they have been directly involved with shaping. Senior leaders know the school, its staff and pupils extremely well. Job descriptions and lines of management have improved since the previous full inspection to ensure that the aims of the school are fulfilled successfully. Managers evaluate performance and set targets for improvement through regular formal and informal lesson observation, through critical and informed analysis of examination results and through analysis of other test results. The detailed and coherent school development plan, which helps to inform department planning, successfully identifies targets for development and also sets out criteria for judging its successful delivery. The development plan is created by and shared amongst the senior leadership team, drawn both from teaching and support staff, and it is regularly evaluated by trustees. 5.7 Academic middle managers respond positively to the detailed analysis of their performance and the targets that are set by senior leadership. In the most innovative"}

The development plan is created by and shared amongst the senior leadership team, drawn both from teaching and support staff, and it is regularly evaluated by trustees. 5.7 Academic middle managers respond positively to the detailed analysis of their performance and the targets that are set by senior leadership. In the most innovative and successful areas of the school, academic middle management is creative in developing and extending the school’s range of subjects on offer. Overall, heads of department play a significant role in shaping academic policy and in ensuring the quality of teaching and learning. The school has a new and evolving professional development scheme for teaching staff which aims to give teachers greater responsibility for their own development. An attitude of shared educational enterprise and openness to new ideas characterises the school’s educational philosophy, which begins with the senior leadership team and permeates through the school. The excellent induction procedures for all newly appointed staff allow all staff to learn from each other. Middle managers show care and commitment in their desire to develop the competence and confidence of newly appointed staff and to integrate them effectively. 5.8 Pastoral leadership and management are excellent. The involvement of the pupils in nominated positions as prefects and peer mentors has been instrumental in the effective delivery of the school’s pastoral care provision. The school’s leaders and managers are very attentive to their roles in promoting and ensuring the pupils’ safeguarding and welfare. The structure of the senior leadership ensures that accountability for the school’s delivery of pastoral care is clear, enabling all staff to feel well supported in their work with the pupils. 5.9 Support staff play a key role in ensuring that the school is a happy, well-presented and secure environment. There is a clear and effective interface between the support staff senior managers, the senior leadership team and the trustees, which ensures that all departments of the school have a clear and well-defined role in helping to achieve the school’s aims and sharing in its successes. Cheltenham College 16 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 20165.10 The school maintains a highly constructive relationship with parents and its communications with them are clear and highly informative. Parents are able to communicate with all members of staff directly by email, and contact between parents and house staff and academic tutors is regular and productive. An overwhelming number of parents who responded to the questionnaire expressed a high level of satisfaction with the education and support provided by the school for their children. There were no areas of concern for significant numbers of parents. Reports on pupils’ academic progress are sent regularly to parents and are both helpful and informative. Academic targets are set clearly and regularly, and parents are actively encouraged to become involved in the monitoring and review of their children’s progress through an online parent portal. Parents’ concerns are dealt with swiftly and professionally. 5.11 Parents are kept well informed through the school’s social network pages, regular newsletters, weekly bulletins and videos. Overseas expeditions and sporting tours often have their own social media area so that parents can follow the progress of their children whilst they are away from home. Parents have a wide range of opportunities to become involved in the life of the school. Events organised by the school are well supported, and parents are encouraged to attend sports fixtures, house social events and musical concerts, together with drama productions and more formal dinners. Parents of prospective pupils receive excellent information about the school, and there is a highly comprehensive induction programme to school life for both pupils and parents. What the school should do to improve is given at the beginning of the report in section 2."}

Regulatory Compliance Inspection Preface The registration authority for independent schools is the Department for Education (DfE), which directs inspection according to a specified frequency or at any time where the DfE has particular concerns about a school. The Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) is the body approved by the Secretary of State for the purpose of inspecting schools which are, or whose heads are, in membership of the associations which form the Independent Schools Council (ISC) and reporting on the extent to which they meet the Independent School Standards (‘the standards’) in the Schedule to the Education (Independent School Standards) Regulations 2014. Accordingly, inspection records whether the school meets each of these standards, which are arranged in eight Parts, each of which is divided into separate paragraphs. Additionally, the inspection reports on the school’s accessibility plan under Schedule 10 of the Equality Act 2010 and the ban on corporal punishment under section 548 of the Education Act 1996. It comments on the progress made by the school in meeting the compliance action points set out in the school’s most recent statutory inspection. This inspection also contains specific judgements on the National Minimum Standards for Boarding Schools (‘boarding NMS’). It also comments on the progress made by the school in meeting the compliance action points set out in the most recent statutory boarding inspection and it judges the extent to which the school currently meets the boarding NMS. It identifies any standards which the school does not meet and requires action to meet them. Findings are distributed across sections relating to the eight Parts of the standards. All association independent schools will have an inspection within three years from April 2016, in accordance with the Framework and DfE requirements. The inspection may be of COMPLIANCE ONLY or a combined inspection of EDUCATIONAL QUALITY AND COMPLIANCE depending on a number of factors, including findings from their most recent inspection. Schools judged not to meet the standards, including the boarding NMS, may also be subject to a progress monitoring visit before their next routine inspection. The progress monitoring visit will judge whether the school has taken the necessary action to meet any un-met standards identified at their previous inspection. The inspection was also carried out under the arrangements of the ISC Associations for the maintenance and improvement of the quality of their membership. This is a COMPLIANCE ONLY inspection and as such reports only on the school’s compliance with the standards, including the boarding NMS. The standards represent minimum requirements and judgements are given either as met or as not met. All schools are required to meet all the standards applicable to them. Where the minimum requirements are not met, this is clearly indicated in the relevant section of the report and the school is required to take the actions specified. Inspections do not include matters that are outside of the regulatory framework described above, such as: an exhaustive health and safety audit; compliance with data protection requirements; an in-depth examination of the structural condition of the school, its services or other physical features; contractual arrangements with parents; an investigation of the financial viability of the school or its accounting procedures. Inspectors may be aware of individual safeguarding concerns, allegations and complaints as part of the inspection process. Such matters will not usually be referred to specifically in published reports in this document but will have been considered by the team in reaching its judgements.

The process consists of two parts: An inspection of educational quality A regulatory compliance inspection From The Head Fantastic buildings and amazing facilities are all nice to have, and we are very lucky that we have both in abundance, but they are not what makes a school special. That must come from the staff, from inspiring, dedicated, extraordinary individuals that will, quite genuinely change the path of children’s lives forever. I am thrilled that, throughout this report, the Inspectors recognised the incredibly close relationship between our staff and our children and the positive influence this has on not only their achievements, but also on ensuring they love the journey too. It is both huge fun, and a real privilege, to be part of this great team and we are all delighted that the Inspectors recognised what we see every day. Tom O’Sullivan, Headmaster CHELTENHAM PREP SCHOOL | ISI EXECUTIVE SUMMARY3The quality of the pupils’ academic and other achievements is excellent. • Pupils from the very youngest demonstrate an excitement to learn, curiosity and excellent attitudes towards their learning. • Pupils have outstanding communication skills; they listen attentively, write with flair and accuracy and are extremely confident and articulate speakers. • Pupils demonstrate strong knowledge, skills and understanding across the range of subjects and apply them extremely effectively. • Pupils successfully apply their excellent numeracy skills to other areas of the curriculum. • Boarders’ excellent achievement is significantly enhanced by the support they receive. Children in the EYFS develop secure foundations to their early literacy and numeracy skills and further their knowledge successfully through a range of well-planned, engaging, and purposeful activities. Pupils thrive on challenge, viewing mistakes as learning opportunities in a learning environment in which governors, leadership and teachers have successfully fulfilled the school’s aim to foster intellectual curiosity, academic rigour, independent learning and interests beyond the academic, which brings enjoyment and enrichment. Pupils of all abilities make rapid progress in their communication skills, because teaching develops confidence, provides challenge and is well-matched to individual needs. Pupils achieve notable success in a wide range of extra-curricular activities in and out of school as they are actively encouraged to follow individual strengths and passions. Boarders say that they value the very strong team spirit and sense of community within the boarding house and being part of the boarding house ‘family’ . Pupils from the very youngest demonstrate an excitement to learn, curiosity and excellent attitudes towards their learning. Pupils develop strong writing skills from an early age, and writing is fluent, well written for purpose and applied successfully across the curriculum. Pupils have a mature appreciation about how to stay safe and physically and mentally healthy, particularly in terms of diet, exercise and a balanced life-style. Throughout the school, within sports teams, on stage and musically, there is a vibrant sense of collaboration and working with, and for, one another. There is a strong awareness of people who are neurodiverse and those from the LGBTQ+ communities, and pupils understand how to interact sensitively with those with SEND and EAL. From the EYFS onwards, children learn how to take time to reflect on their own wellbeing practise strategies such as mindfulness and yoga to introduce calm into their daily lives. Pupils said that they feel extremely well-supported through the school’s PSHE and relationships and education (RSE) programmes, and their strong relationships with their teachers. Pupils talked positively about how they celebrate each other’s cultures in assembles and through the activities in the boarding house. They are sensitive to and tolerant of those from backgrounds and traditions different to their own. Pupils reported in interviews that everyone feels valued in the school community. [Pupils] know how and where to seek help if they are worried or anxious. This was strongly emphasised by pupils’ discussion, who spoke with enthusiasm about how well they are supported and advised by the school and their teachers.

Through the ‘Chadwick Leadership Programme’ , pupils in Year 8 contribute to both the school and the wider community, undertaking a range of activities which include working with partner primary schools, raising funds for charities such as the local animal sanctuary and clearing overgrown local footpaths. Pupils work extremely well together, in lessons, house meetings, school council or eco-committee towards common goals. The quality of the pupils’ personal development is excellent. • Pupils are reflective and self-assured, able to review and improve, and they are well-prepared for the next stage of their education. • All pupils demonstrate outstanding levels of of self-awareness, self-confidence and, resilience because of their warm relationships with teachers and leaders. • Pupils have excellent social skills, respect each other and have a strong sense of belonging. • Pupils have a strong understanding of and a commitment to celebrating diversity. Pupils embrace the school ethos, which provides a clear framework for personal development and results in pupils who are confident, well-rounded and curious, enabling them to develop into respectful, resilient young people. The development of pupils’ strong sense of right and wrong begins in the EYFS where they learn to understand the impact of their actions on others, and acts of kindness are recognised. Pupils increasingly develop the ability to make important decisions maturely and reflectively, understanding that the decisions they make have an impact on their lives and success. Pupils employ mindfulness techniques and appreciate the opportunities in outdoor learning to connect with nature, deepening their appreciation of it. In interviews, pupils said that they regard members of staff and older pupils as role models and respect them.

The range of these Regulations can be viewed on the website www.legislation.gov.uk. Additionally, inspections will consider the school’s accessibility plan under Schedule 10 of the Equality Act 2010 and the ban on corporal punishment introduced by the School Standards and Framework Act 1998.This inspection report follows the ISI schedule. The inspection on which the report is based took place over a period of four continuous days in the school.The previous ISI intermediate boarding inspection was in May 2014 and the previous ISI standard inspection was in October 2010.The inspection was also carried out under the arrangements of the ISC Associations for the maintenance and improvement of the quality of their membership.ISI is also approved to inspect the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), which was introduced in September 2008 and applies to all children in England from birth to 31 August following their fifth birthday. This report evaluates the extent to which the setting fulfils the requirements of the Early Years Foundation Stage Statutory Framework published by the Department for Education (DfE) and follows the requirements of the Childcare Act 2006 as subsequently amended.This inspection contains specific judgements on the National Minimum Standards for Boarding Schools. It comments on the progress made by the school in meeting the recommendations set out in the most recent statutory boarding inspection and evaluates the quality of the boarding experience and its contribution to pupils’ education, personal development and welfare.The inspection of the school is from an educational perspective and provides limited inspection of other aspects, although inspectors comment on any significant hazards or problems they encounter which have an adverse impact on children. The inspection does not include:(i)an exhaustive health and safety audit;(ii)an in-depth examination of the structural condition of the school, its services or other physical features;(iii)an investigation of the financial viability of the school or its accounting procedures;(iv)an in-depth investigation of the school’s compliance with employment law.Inspectors may be aware of individual safeguarding concerns, allegations and complaints as part of the inspection process. Such matters will not usually be referred to in the published report but will have been considered by the team in reaching their judgements.Both Ofsted and ISI inspect and report on the Independent School Standards Regulations. However, they apply different frameworks and have different criteria for judging school quality that are suited to the different types of schools they inspect. Both use a four point scale when making judgements of quality but, whilst the ISI terminology reflects quality judgements that are at least equivalent to those used by Ofsted, they also reflect the differences in approach. ISI reports do not provide a single overarching judgement for the school but instead give a clear judgement on each aspect of the school’s work at the beginning of each section. These headline statements must include one of the ISI descriptors ‘excellent’, ‘good’, ‘sound’ or ‘unsatisfactory’, and where Achievement is © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2016‘exceptional’ that term may be used for the top grade. Elsewhere in the report, inspectors may use a range of different adjectives to make judgements. For EYFS registered provision (for children aged under two), reports are required to use the same terminology (‘outstanding’, ‘good’, ‘requires improvement’ and ‘inadequate’) as Ofsted reports. © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2016INSPECTION EVIDENCEThe inspectors observed lessons, conducted formal interviews with pupils and examined samples of pupils’ work.

It aims to equip pupils to lead fulfilled and purposeful lives by providing an excellent all-round education founded on Christian principles. The school values pupils as individuals with unique talents and interests, and seeks to foster intellectual curiosity and the ability to learn independently. It sets out to foster an awareness of others through spiritual, moral and aesthetic awareness and a breadth of understanding. The school is governed jointly with the senior school under a single governing body. The headmaster of the college has overall responsibility for both the senior school and the preparatory school.1.2The school was founded, as part of Cheltenham College, in 1841 but became a separate junior school in 1865 and moved to the current site opposite the senior school in 1909. It was known at that time as Cheltenham College Junior School. The pre-preparatory department, known as Kingfishers and accommodating children from the Nursery to Year 2, was opened in 1993. The school became fully co-educational in 1998. Boarders are accommodated in a single boarding house, which offers full, weekly and flexible boarding options.1.3Since the previous inspection, a new preparatory school headmaster has been appointed and the senior management of the school has been restructured. Refurbishment of an existing building has provided a new science and technology block. In 2013, the school was renamed Cheltenham College Preparatory School.1.4The school offers Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) provision to children in its Nursery and Reception classes. There are currently 393 pupils on roll, 44 of whom are in the EYFS. There are 67 pupils in Years 1 and 2, 86 pupils in Years 3 and 4 (the Lower School), 94 in Years 5 and 6 (the Middle School), and 102 in Years 7 and 8 (the Upper School).1.5Results of standardised tests indicate that the ability profile of the school is above the national average. Most pupils are of at least above average ability, with some year groups having a notable proportion of pupils with well above average ability. Day pupils travel to the school from the surrounding counties and boarders come from the local area, across the UK and abroad. The majority of pupils are of white British origin. A small number come from"}

Day pupils travel to the school from the surrounding counties and boarders come from the local area, across the UK and abroad. The majority of pupils are of white British origin. A small number come from European, African and Asian countries. Most pupils come from a range of professional backgrounds, including the armed forces.1.6Sixty pupils have been identified as having special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND) and forty of these receive specialist support from the school. Five pupils have a statement of special educational needs or an education, health and care plan funded by the local authority. Of the thirty-five pupils who speak English as an additional language (EAL), twelve are currently at an early stage of learning English and receive additional language support.1.7National Curriculum nomenclature is used throughout this report to refer to year groups in the school. Cheltenham College Preparatory School2 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 20162.THE SUCCESS OF THE SCHOOL2.(a)Main findings2.1Pupils at Cheltenham College Preparatory School make excellent progress and achieve highly. Throughout the school, including the EYFS, they develop high levels of understanding, knowledge and skills across the curriculum, and are exceptionally well prepared for transfers at each stage and to their senior school. Children in the EYFS and those pupils with SEND or EAL make excellent progress overall. The excellent, well-balanced curriculum, which includes a wide range of extra-curricular activities, trips and visits, and links with the local community, supports pupils’ learning extremely well. Creative use of the EYFS outdoor area has improved the children’s overall experience. In the EYFS, children’s opportunities to develop and extend their own learning are limited by the number and frequency of specialist lessons. Teaching is excellent. Lessons are thoughtfully planned, using highly effective tracking data to ensure that the lessons meet the needs of all abilities, including the more able; this represents significant progress since the previous inspection. At its best, marking provides constructive comments, targets for improvement and an expectation that pupils will take responsibility for self-assessment. However, the school has not met fully the previous inspection recommendation to ensure that all marking is in accordance with best practice, in that the quality of marking is still variable in the middle and upper sections of the school. Provision for personal, social and heath education (PSHE) does not yet allocate planned time for pupils to explore personal and social issues in depth. Pupils’ excellent attitudes to their learning and their exemplary behaviour play a significant part in contributing to their excellent educational experiences.2.2Pupils develop an excellent level of personal development as they move through the school, in line with the aim to develop a breadth of understanding of spiritual, moral and aesthetic awareness, as well as respect for people and the environment. Pupils develop easy relationships with each other, whatever their background, faith or culture. They understand the core values found in British society and show great concern for those less fortunate than themselves through their involvement in charitable fund raising. The excellent pastoral care and meticulously maintained arrangements for welfare, health and safety support pupils’ spiritual, moral, social and cultural awareness exceptionally well. The boarding experience also makes an excellent contribution to boarders’ personal development by providing an environment where pupils feel at home, safe and well supported in every way.2.3Excellent governance, leadership and management enable the school’s aims to be well met. The governing body has strengthened its range of experience and expertise and has excellent oversight of the school. Governors are frequent visitors to the school and understand its strengths and areas for development well. Since the previous inspection, the senior leadership of the school has been restructured, roles of middle managers have been redefined and monitoring of the school is now highly effective, meeting a previous recommendation. A detailed process of self-evaluation has informed a new school development plan that sets out"}

A detailed process of self-evaluation has informed a new school development plan that sets out clear targets for the future, also meeting a recommendation from the previous inspection. Management processes are now excellent. Communication amongst staff is a strength of the school, resulting in excellent support and challenge for every pupil. Links with parents are highly effective in supporting pupils’ achievements and personal development. Cheltenham College Preparatory School3 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 20162.(b)Action points(i)Compliance with regulatory requirements2.4The school meets all the requirements of the Education (Independent School Standards) Regulations 2014.2.5The school meets all the National Minimum Standards for Boarding Schools 2015.(ii)Recommendations for further improvement2.6The school is advised to make the following improvements.1.Provide sufficient opportunities for pupils to extend their thinking and learning for PSHE topics in the timetable.2.Ensure greater consistency in marking and target setting in the Middle School and Upper School.3.In the EYFS, provide uninterrupted opportunities for sustained learning so that children can develop their learning and thinking skills. Cheltenham College Preparatory School4 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 20163.THE QUALITY OF ACADEMIC AND OTHER ACHIEVEMENTS3.(a)The quality of the pupils’ achievements and learning3.1The quality of pupils’ achievements and learning is excellent.3.2In the EYFS all children, including the youngest and those with SEND or EAL, make at least good, but more often outstanding, progress in relation to their starting points. The vast majority exceed the Early Learning Goals at the end of Reception. Children are articulate and express themselves clearly, according to their age and stage. The youngest children recognise their names and can identify which letter sound they begin with. They delight in listening to stories and are able to predict what will happen and talk about the pictures. They recognise and sequence numbers to 10 and some can count up to 20.3.3Children in Reception can write simple sentences, in which most letters are formed correctly. They have very good phonic knowledge and some use this to write lengthier pieces of text, using capital letters and full stops. Children can count in tens, find coins to match an amount and complete simple calculations. The children are active learners. They thoroughly enjoy the challenges they are set and demonstrate the ability to play and learn independently and to think critically and solve problems. For example, children in the Nursery delighted in taking off their shoes and placing them inside a mock giant dinosaur’s footprint to see how many they needed to fill it.3.4Across Years 1 to 8, pupils’ achievement has improved significantly since the previous inspection. Pupils listen attentively and respectfully to each other, they express themselves articulately and with assurance, and they show high levels of knowledge and skills in literacy and numeracy. Numerous examples were seen of thoughtful extended writing resulting from imaginatively titled project work. Pupils work logically in mathematics and many have quick mental recall of key information. Higher order scientific skills were observed amongst pupils of all ages, as seen in a lesson designed to work out the energy value of a number of different foods. Across the school, including in the EYFS, pupils have well-developed information and communication technology (ICT) skills that are used to good effect in many subjects.3.5Pupils’ creativity is excellent and they express this to a high standard in music. Two pupils have been awarded places in the National Children’s Orchestra of Great Britain. Significant numbers of pupils learn musical instruments and many achieve high grades for their age in external musical examinations. Choral singing is of a high standard and contributes to the school’s aim to foster talents and interests that bring enjoyment and enrichment to the pupils taking part and to others. Pupils demonstrate well-developed skills in art and design work, as seen in a lesson"}

Choral singing is of a high standard and contributes to the school’s aim to foster talents and interests that bring enjoyment and enrichment to the pupils taking part and to others. Pupils demonstrate well-developed skills in art and design work, as seen in a lesson where they were tackling oblique and isometric projection drawing. Pupils have also experienced success in national competitions in story writing and historical knowledge.3.6Pupils enjoy a variety of sports and many excel. Whole year groups represent the school in matches; regular tournaments with local schools, such as the innovative ‘Barbarians’ rugby tournaments, provide opportunities for pupils of all abilities to improve their skills and techniques. A significant number of pupils enjoy success at county and national level in a diverse range of sports, including rugby, hockey, swimming, athletics and skiing. Cheltenham College Preparatory School5 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 20163.7Although pupils’ attainment cannot be measured in relation to average performance in national tests, it is judged to be high in relation to national average expectations. The highly effective use of standardised tests ensures that the school has an extremely detailed knowledge of individual performances and, as a result, there is no significant difference in the progress of different groups of pupils. Work scrutiny, lesson observations and discussions with pupils show that attainment is high and progress rapid in relation to pupils of comparable ability. The rapid progress made by pupils with SEND or EAL is due to early identification of needs, the high quality teaching, and the individual help and support provided by learning support interventions. More able pupils achieve highly through a wide range of opportunities to extend their learning in class and take part in specific challenge activities.3.8Over the last four years, all Year 8 pupils have gained places at their first-choice senior school; a significant number with scholarships and awards for academic success, music, art, drama, design and technology, and sport.3.9Pupils of all ages show a great eagerness to learn and enthusiasm for their lessons. Their behaviour in lessons is exemplary, which enables teachers to make highly productive use of lesson time. They work well independently and support each other highly effectively when working in groups. Responses to the pre-inspection questionnaires showed that a very large majority of pupils and parents are pleased with the progress that is made.3.(b)The contribution of curricular and extra-curricular provision3.10The contribution of curricular and extra-curricular provision is excellent.3.11Responses to the pre-inspection questionnaires showed that pupils and parents are completely satisfied with the curriculum and co-curricular programme provided by the school.3.12The EYFS provides a broad curriculum, enhanced by specialist teaching in a range of extra subjects, for example music, French, swimming, games and physical education. Outdoor learning in a woodland area and a wide range of interesting trips further enhance the curriculum. In Reception, however, the frequency and number of these specialist lessons limit the time available for engagement in sustained learning activities in the classroom or outdoor areas, resulting in a fragmented experience for the children. This interrupts independent learning and limits the opportunities for extended explorative and investigative experiences.3.13The space and resources in the Nursery outdoor area ensure that the youngest children gain daily direct access to planned outdoor activities, which complement the indoor provision and give children opportunities for some larger-scale physical play and exploration. Creative use of outdoor spaces adjoined to and near the Reception classrooms means that children have opportunities to play in the fresh air every day; leaders have worked hard to improve outdoor provision since the previous inspection. In the EYFS, activities and opportunities for learning are varied according to individual children and groups of children’s needs. Children with SEND or EAL, or those who are particularly able, are identified early, closely monitored and sensitively supported.3.14From Year 1 to Year 8 the curriculum supports the school’s aims to equip pupils to lead fulfilled and purposeful lives by providing"}

Children with SEND or EAL, or those who are particularly able, are identified early, closely monitored and sensitively supported.3.14From Year 1 to Year 8 the curriculum supports the school’s aims to equip pupils to lead fulfilled and purposeful lives by providing an excellent all-round education, which exceeds the required areas of coverage and promotes pupils’ knowledge and understanding of fundamental British values. It successfully meets the needs of Cheltenham College Preparatory School6 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2016pupils of all ages and abilities, providing a rich and stimulating experience that facilitates their attainment of high standards. An integrated approach to the coverage of national and international political issues, through a combination of assemblies and house meetings, ensures that pupils receive a balanced view of different beliefs and opinions and that they build resilience of thought for their future lives. Provision for PSHE does not yet afford planned time for pupils to explore personal and social issues in depth.3.15French is studied from the Nursery, and in Year 5 pupils study Spanish for half the academic year and French for the other half. Pupils can then choose which modern foreign language they wish to continue with for the remainder of time that they are in the school.3.16Pupils with SEND or EAL, and those who are more able, are supported extremely well both by the curriculum and by co-curricular provision. Pupils are set according to ability in the core subjects from an early stage, and interventions for pupils with SEND put in place, including specialist support lessons. Able and gifted pupils benefit from challenging courses and extension work in lessons, and any pupil demonstrating particular skills or strengths can benefit from the Stretch and Challenge programme, which provides opportunities to experience activities involving higher-order thinking skills.3.17Pupils have wide-ranging opportunities to learn beyond the classroom and are actively involved in the choice of the activities on offer. Visitors to the school and visits outside are purposefully integrated into the curriculum. They are highly effective in broadening pupils’ horizons. For example, some of the choir members represented the school in a choral tour of Rome. There are also regular visits abroad to enhance learning in modern foreign languages. Success in co-curricular activities is celebrated equally with academic achievement within the school, allowing all abilities or strengths to be a significant factor in the promotion of personal qualities.3.18Pupils benefit greatly from links with the local community. Music scholars play at a local care home and at a maintained school, and the school regularly participates in the Shakespeare Schools Festival. At Christmas, the school choirs perform at a number of local venues. The science, technology, engineering and mathematics club is participating in a competition, supported by a local engineering company, to design and build a model plane. Representatives from this organisation regularly come into the school to help promote this competition and to advise the pupils. Cheltenham College Preparatory School7 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 20163.(c)The contribution of teaching3.19The contribution of teaching is excellent.3.20In the EYFS, staff have very high expectations of the children. Teachers are well qualified and very experienced; they therefore have an excellent knowledge and understanding of how to promote the learning and development of young children and of what they can achieve. Well-considered, very detailed planning provides an excellent balance of stimulating and enjoyable adult-led and child-initiated activities. The arrangements for observation and assessment are highly effective, enabling staff to ensure that each child’s individual interests and needs are fully met.3.21Staff have created exciting, enticing learning environments that provide plentiful opportunity for active learning and in which children can achieve very well. An excellent range of easily accessible, age-appropriate resources thoroughly engage and motivate the children, and enable them to develop their skills very effectively.3.22Throughout the school, teaching promotes a positive atmosphere of learning, tolerance and mutual respect, reflecting the school’s aims to foster intellectual curiosity"}

An excellent range of easily accessible, age-appropriate resources thoroughly engage and motivate the children, and enable them to develop their skills very effectively.3.22Throughout the school, teaching promotes a positive atmosphere of learning, tolerance and mutual respect, reflecting the school’s aims to foster intellectual curiosity and academic rigour. Dedicated teachers and support staff work hard to motivate and inspire pupils. They recognise individual needs, endeavouring to develop talents and skills, and striving for excellence across the curriculum. Care is taken to ensure that political issues are covered in such a way that all opinions and ideas are represented fairly, and that teaching promotes tolerance and respect. Pupils report that they have confidence in their teachers, that they feel very well supported and that they enjoy their learning.3.23Throughout the school, teaching is successful in enabling pupils to make excellent progress. Most teaching is characterised by excellent subject knowledge and thoughtful planning, and a variety of methods is used to stimulate interest. In the best lessons, lively teaching, a fast pace and incisive questioning techniques ensure that pupils are challenged to think for themselves, to question the ideas of others and to take responsibility for their own learning. For example, in a dynamic Year 7 history lesson, pupils enjoyed trying to solve the mystery of William Rufus’s death, using visual and written evidence thoughtfully. Homework is used effectively to reinforce class learning and to offer opportunities for independent research.3.24Teaching responds effectively to the pupils’ differing learning needs. Teachers pay great attention to the individual educational plans of pupils with SEND or EAL and ensure that their needs are met in class so that all pupils are able to make the best possible progress, including those with a statement of special educational needs or an education, health and care plan. During the inspection, the use of colour-coded worksheets in an English lesson enabled lower ability pupils to respond to questions at their own level when interpreting a challenging text. Reponses to the pre-inspection questionnaire showed that a small minority of parents felt that more able pupils are not given enough support. Inspectors found that extension work is provided for more able pupils in class and many are included in the Stretch and Challenge programme and other opportunities for enrichment. Overall, the school now meets the recommendation from the previous inspection to ensure that the work set for pupils, particularly the more able pupils in the Middle School and Upper School, is more closely matched to their differing abilities.3.25Since the previous inspection, a particular focus on the quality of teaching has done much to raise overall standards. A comprehensive whole-school marking policy is in Cheltenham College Preparatory School8 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2016place, which partly meets a recommendation from the previous inspection. The best marking is constructive, gives encouragement and offers guidance to pupils on how they can improve their work. However, there is still a lack of consistency in marking, particularly with regard to the use of target setting in the middle and upper sections of the school.3.26The school makes very good use of ICT to support learning across the curriculum. During the inspection, interactive whiteboards were used to enhance learning in many of the lessons. In a mathematics lesson in the Lower School, pupils confidently used tablet computers to reinforce their times tables knowledge and link it to the inverse process of division.3.27Assessment and monitoring are strong. Pupils are regularly assessed using a range of standardised tests. These results are analysed, then communicated to all teachers and stored on the school database. This detailed analysis of data enables the school to track and monitor the progress of pupils of all abilities. Teachers use this evidence to inform future planning and the choice of teaching methods. Systematic tracking of pupils means that those with SEND or EAL, as well as able, gifted and talented pupils, are identified quickly"}

Cheltenham College Preparatory School9 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 20164.THE QUALITY OF THE PUPILS’ PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT4.(a)The spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of the pupils4.1The spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of the pupils is excellent.4.2In the EYFS, a very high priority is given to children’s personal, social and emotional development. Children hone skills for the future extremely well; they are independent, confident and self-assured. Children of all ages are given plentiful opportunity to make choices and decisions in their daily routines, learning and play. Staff encourage them to take turns and, as a result, they play co-operatively and harmoniously with or alongside each other. They understand the need to share and to help each other, and often do so unprompted by adults.4.3Children are aware of the differences between themselves and others, and they show respect for one another. They listen attentively to each other. For example, in the Nursery, they talked about something that is special to them and, in Reception, they explained what they had just learnt in a mathematics lesson. Children learn to celebrate each other’s cultures and learn about fundamental British values through their day-to-day activities.4.4Transitions are managed very effectively; staff work closely with parents and children to ensure that transfer at each point goes smoothly. Children are given much opportunity to become familiar with the environment and adults in their new class. In addition, there is a thorough handover of information and records.4.5Throughout the school, pupils’ personal qualities are well developed, in accordance with the school’s aim of providing a holistic education that equips them for life in a complex, fast-changing and multi-cultural society. Christian values form the basis of the education provided, and pupils are valued as individuals with their own unique talents and interests. Pupils’ spiritual awareness is strong, fostered through a wide range of opportunities. They attend the college chapel for a weekly service led by the senior chaplain. They find the scenic surroundings spiritually uplifting and enjoy the opportunity to sing in the choir or to sit in silent reflection. Pupils show an unusually strong appreciation for non-material aspects of life and they demonstrate a strong love of art, music and drama.4.6Throughout the school, pupils have extremely well-developed, mature personalities for their age. They are happy and well motivated, and show respect and tolerance for each other’s differences. Pupils work, share and play exceptionally well together. They are happy to explain what they are doing and they share their ideas readily. They learn quickly, and develop self-confidence in an environment where they are valued as individuals.4.7Pupils’ moral development is very strong. From an early age, they understand the difference between right and wrong, the need for school rules and the importance of taking responsibility for their own behaviour. Through the pre-inspection questionnaire a very small minority of pupils expressed the view that rewards and sanctions are not always applied fairly. Discussion with pupils and a scrutiny of the systems and records showed that this is not the case. Inspectors found that pupils are self-disciplined and they understand the school’s system of sanctions and rewards well. Pupils respond positively to the guidance and advice of their teachers. They demonstrate understanding and respect for British institutions and services, and the civil and criminal law of the country, as well as for moral and ethical values Cheltenham College Preparatory School10 © Independent Schools Inspectorate"}

They demonstrate understanding and respect for British institutions and services, and the civil and criminal law of the country, as well as for moral and ethical values Cheltenham College Preparatory School10 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2016such as the concept of individual liberty. These values are promoted through topics discussed in PSHE, well-focussed religious studies lessons and assemblies. However, dedicated time for PSHE is disjointed, which limits opportunities for detailed exploration of key social issues.4.8The social development of the pupils is excellent. Throughout the school, they demonstrate kindness and respect for others, including those of different cultures. Pupils of all ages are keen to accept positions of responsibility. Reflecting the aims of the school, they display a sense of community and recognise that they have a key part to play in it. When responding to the pre-inspection questionnaire, a small minority of pupils suggested that there are not many opportunities for them to take on leadership roles. Inspection evidence showed that a variety of roles were available, including monitors, house captains, school councillors, sports captains and mentors. Pupils work very well in mixed age groups, assisting one another and sharing skills and ideas. They demonstrate a deep sense of social responsibility, making significant donations to Gloucestershire Bundles, a local charity for the homeless, and organising fund raising for many prominent national charities.4.9Pupils’ cultural development is excellent. Pupils are open-minded, respectful and tolerant of a range of cultural traditions and backgrounds, and they appreciate what it means to live in a multi-cultural society and how to combat discrimination of any kind. Pupils have a secure understanding of Western cultural traditions and of different religions, developed through a range of curricular areas. They appreciate the key features of British citizenship and have a clear understanding of how the democratic process works. Their excellent cultural awareness is enhanced by a wide-ranging programme of visits to such places as the Globe Theatre and the Imperial War Museum.4.10As a result of outstanding individual care and the breadth of their experiences, the standard of pupils’ personal development is extremely high by the time they leave the school.4.(b)The contribution of arrangements for pastoral care4.11The quality of pastoral care is excellent.4.12In the EYFS, children of all ages form secure emotional attachments and positive relationships with their key person and other staff. Adults work very closely together to ensure that all children are happy and confident. Older children are able to identify adults they can speak to if they are upset or hurt, safe in the knowledge that they will support and help them; they say that they feel safe in school. The excellent care provided ensures that all children’s needs are fully met.4.13Behaviour is exemplary. On the very rare occasions when adults need to intervene to manage behaviour, they do so calmly, using well-considered, consistent messages to support those children who need it. Children have useful strategies of their own, which they use to try to solve any minor conflicts for themselves. Very high standards of courtesy are consistently and effectively promoted and demonstrated.4.14Children in Reception are able to explain why it is important to take exercise, eat vegetables and drink water in order to be healthy. They learn about hygiene through daily routines such as washing their hands before eating and are able to explain the importance of this. There are many opportunities for the children to be physically active during specialist lessons, adult-led sessions and daily outdoor play. Cheltenham College Preparatory School11 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 20164.15Throughout the school pupils’ development is assisted by strong relationships with each other and with staff. Teachers and tutors know their pupils extremely well and are adept at helping them to take advantage of the opportunities provided by the school. All pupils questioned said that they knew who to go to if they had any concerns."}

Teachers and tutors know their pupils extremely well and are adept at helping them to take advantage of the opportunities provided by the school. All pupils questioned said that they knew who to go to if they had any concerns. They can speak to an appropriate adult, raise a matter by email using a dedicated address or place a written concern in a ‘worry box’, anonymously if they wish.4.16The pastoral structures include ready lines of communication to senior management. Records are thoroughly kept and allow overall patterns to be identified. Regular pastoral meetings amongst staff, as well as an extremely efficient system for logging discussions, enable communication between various parties to be thorough and rigorous.4.17Pupils are confident and happy. The school has established a very positive ethos where pupils readily recognise that bullying or harassment of any kind are unacceptable. Those questioned considered that bullying is rare, and all were confident with the school’s ability to deal with it efficiently. They are aware of the issues of cyber bullying and know how to keep themselves safe online. A very small minority of parents considered that the school does not handle complaints of bullying adequately. A scrutiny of school records showed that the three-stage school policy includes a proactive approach to countering bullying and that careful records are maintained. It was clear from discussions with pupils that they understood and valued the processes involved.4.18A very small minority of pupils felt that they do not have opportunities to have their views heard. Inspectors found that pupils have many opportunities to have their ideas represented. The school council and boarding house committee allow pupil representatives to relay the views and opinions of their peers. Pupils are encouraged to be healthy through developing good eating habits and taking regular exercise. The extensive games programme ensures that everyone exercises regularly. Food is nutritious and pupils are educated about healthy eating.4.19The school has an appropriately detailed three-year accessibility plan for pupils with SEND.4.(c)The contribution of arrangements for welfare, health and safety4.20The contribution of arrangements for welfare, health and safety is excellent.4.21In the EYFS, children’s welfare is given a high priority and staff are fully committed to keeping children safe. Rigorous risk assessments of all areas used by the EYFS children result in robust procedures for the prompt identification, reporting and rectifying of potential hazards. Buildings have secure entrances and all staff are aware of security procedures, including parents’ designation of named adults for collecting their children from school. Attendance is carefully monitored and care taken to prevent radicalisation and extremism in any form.4.22The school is most thorough in its attention to issues of safeguarding, both in the EYFS and elsewhere, and its policy and procedures are meticulous in their attention to detail, and these have a significant impact on pupils’ welfare and safety. Staff receive high quality and timely training, and a full induction process ensures that all new staff are familiar with safeguarding procedures and all other aspects of health and safety. The school maintains excellent links with local agencies. Recruitment Cheltenham College Preparatory School12 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2016procedures are thorough and systematic, and the required checks on staff are accurately recorded and securely stored on the single central register.4.23The school maintains outstanding records on all matters relating to welfare, health and safety. Systems for monitoring the arrangements for health and safety are rigorous, and the committee that meets twice a term includes members from all areas of the school, demonstrating the importance that the school places on such matters. The governing body provides highly effective oversight.4.24Protection of pupils throughout the school is given high priority. The school takes all necessary measures to reduce the risk from fire and other hazards. Detailed and efficient arrangements are in place and staff are appropriately trained. Regular fire practices are held and results are noted and discussed."}

Regular fire practices are held and results are noted and discussed. These comments are used to further improve the school’s practice. Comprehensive risk assessments are in place for every aspect of school life. Health and safety policies are updated annually.4.25Pupils who are ill or injured are exceptionally well cared for on site in the well-resourced health centre. This provides exemplary facilities where sick pupils can be cared for. Throughout the school a high proportion of staff receive first-aid training, and measures for overseeing its delivery are highly effective.4.26Admission and attendance registers are accurately maintained and stored over the required period for future reference.4.(d)The quality of boarding4.27The quality of boarding is excellent.4.28Outcomes for boarders are excellent. The boarders’ personal development is clearly promoted by their boarding experience, enabling them to develop key qualities such as tolerance, confidence and growing independence. Boarders say that the school is a “happy place” and boarding is “amazing”. Boarders and staff speak of family and a sense of community. Excellent relationships exist between boarders of all ages and nationalities, and with staff. Dedicated staff work with great commitment and boarders are appreciative of the efforts staff make on their behalf. The boarders are considerate towards one another and inspectors found them to be extremely polite. Boarding staff have excellent links with academic staff, promoting academic achievement.4.29The boarders say that there is a wide range of people they can talk to, if the need arises, and the telephone numbers of the independent listener and Children’s Commissioner are displayed and are acknowledged by the pupils. Boarders are given positions of responsibility, including head boarders who help with the running of the house and boarding mentors who act as leaders of their dormitories, enabling them to develop strong leadership skills. The boarders feel listened to through the boarding council and are confident in expressing their views in an open atmosphere. Developments brought about by the council include a change in routine and the purchase of beanbags. Boarders have access to the world around them through newspapers, television and appropriate internet facilities.4.30The quality of boarding provision and care is excellent. New boarders say that they are welcomed into the community by other boarders and staff, and that they quickly settle into their “new family”. Prior to joining the school, boarders and parents are Cheltenham College Preparatory School13 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2016given helpful handbooks and boarders receive a thorough induction procedure on arrival, including being assigned a ‘buddy’.4.31There are effective policies in place for the care of boarders who are unwell. Health centre nurses, assisted by suitably trained house staff, provide excellent medical care and boarders say that, should they be ill, they are very well looked after. A doctor also holds regular surgeries, and local specialist services can be accessed, including a dentist and an optician. Counsellors are also attached to the health centre, providing another means of support.4.32Meals are of a high standard; boarders say that they enjoy their meals and were observed to have healthy appetites. When possible, fresh local produce is used and baking is done on site. Special dietary needs are catered for. Themed days are sometimes held, for example a Chinese day, and there is always a birthday cake for boarders. A very small minority of pupils felt that snacks are not readily available. Inspectors judged that the range of evening snacks, extra treats and drinks provided in house are of excellent quality and quantity.4.33Boarding accommodation is excellent; the rooms are brightly decorated, light, airy and clean, and boarders are happy in their environment.

They can personalise their own areas, adding to the homely feel. There are comfortable common rooms where they enjoy socialising and there is also a quiet room for boarders, meeting the recommendation from the last inspection. Most boarders are enthusiastic about a wide range of activities, especially at the weekend when they have supervised access to the local town, movie nights with popcorn and trips off site, for example to theme parks and cooking experiences. During the week popular choices include swimming, craft, design and technology, and a youth club, where boarders play various games. Laundry is managed to a high standard on site. Regular contact with parents is maintained by telephone, email and internet calls.4.34The effectiveness of arrangements for welfare and safeguarding is excellent. The school operates safer recruitment procedures for all staff. Staff, including ancillary support staff, receive regular safeguarding training and are aware of their responsibilities. Several members of staff are on duty in the boarding houses at any time and boarders are regularly registered, ensuring that staff know their whereabouts at all times. Regular fire drills are held and boarders demonstrated a clear knowledge of evacuation procedures Boarders say that they feel safe. An anti-bullying policy is in place and boarders say that bullying, including cyber bullying, is not a concern and that any instance would be quickly dealt with. In addition, there are policies to promote good behaviour, and boarders were seen to behave extremely well.4.35The effectiveness of leadership and management within the boarding provision is excellent. There is a suitable statement of the school’s boarding principles and practice, which is successfully implemented. The Council is actively involved in the running of the school. The boarding team is very well led and supported by the senior leadership team. Staff have regular appraisals and opportunities for further training. Regular meetings of staff, at all levels, are held, enabling them to monitor boarders’ progress and academic achievement, and to achieve links between their academic and pastoral lives. This results in the excellent overall care of boarders. In pre-inspection questionnaire responses, parents and boarders were extremely positive about the boarding provision. Cheltenham College Preparatory School14 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 20165.THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GOVERNANCE, LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT5.(a)The quality of governance5.1The quality of governance is excellent.5.2Governance is strong in the EYFS and members of the Council, some of whom have Early Years experience, work with staff to keep abreast of the regulatory requirements that are specific to the EYFS.5.3Since the previous inspection, the range of experience and expertise represented on the Council has been strengthened and carefully chosen appointments made. Regular and highly effective monitoring of all sections of the school ensures that all members of the Council have an excellent understanding of the school’s strengths and areas requiring development. The Council successfully fulfils its responsibilities for improving educational standards and for strong financial planning. Since the previous inspection, the school has been successful in recruiting a number of high quality staff to senior positions to ensure continuous development of the school. Significant levels of investment have provided a new teaching block for the preparatory school, and the boarding house has undergone a programme of refurbishment to provide updated bathroom facilities and a quiet area for boarders, in response to a previous inspection recommendation.5.4Governors visit the school regularly. They have excellent relationships with senior leaders and staff. A number of sub-committees meet regularly and provide regular reports to update the full board on all aspects of the school, including matters of regulatory compliance, educational standards and financial strategic planning. Governors have high expectations, and their detailed knowledge of the school ensures that they are able to offer informed support, challenge and constructive contributions in all areas.5.5Governors have undertaken extensive training to"}

Arrangements for welfare, health and safety and for child protection are robust. The safer recruitment procedures are comprehensive and the single central register is accurately maintained. All governors receive detailed termly reports on safeguarding matters, which inform the annual review of safeguarding procedures by the full board.5.(b)The quality of leadership and management, including links with parents, carers and guardians5.6The quality of leadership and management, including links with parents, carers and guardians, is excellent.5.7Leadership and management within the EYFS are excellent and a particular strength of the setting. Leaders and Early Years staff evaluate their practice on a daily basis to ensure continuous improvement to provide the best possible opportunities and experiences for the children in their care. Leaders have undertaken self-evaluation and this forms the basis of the aspirational vision and focused development plan for the future of the EYFS.5.8Leaders fully understand their responsibilities to safeguard the children and monitor the educational programmes and outcomes. Systems are robust and scrutiny of Cheltenham College Preparatory School15 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2016data, tracking and assessments is forensic; leaders not only know precisely where each child is in their learning journey, but can also identify strengths and areas for development for groups of children and the curriculum provision overall.5.9Staff in the EYFS are supervised appropriately. One-to-one meetings take place with leaders; these provide an opportunity for the staff to discuss the children in their care, as well as their own professional needs. Staff have undertaken all statutory training and work hard to keep themselves up to date with current trends in the Early Years. Whilst fewer opportunities are provided for professional development aimed at improving teaching skills, staff keep a log of anything they have learnt and share ideas to improve overall provision and outcomes for children. All staff respect the aims and ethos of the school, ensuring the recognition of diversity and the active promotion of democracy, equality and British values.5.10At all levels of responsibility, the leadership and management of the school are highly effective in achieving its aims. Leadership and management have been successful in recruiting high quality staff who understand the ethos of the school and embrace the idea of providing pupils with a range of experiences that support their personal development and engender a genuine love of learning.5.11Arrangements and training for staff and governors, with regard to safeguarding, safer recruitment and welfare, health and safety, are meticulously maintained and comprehensive records kept and monitored. A broad range of regular in-service training, a system of staff appraisal and opportunities for professional development are significant factors in the success of the school. Since the previous inspection, the school has developed the management structure and defined the roles of all leaders. This has facilitated the introduction of a strong process for the monitoring of teaching and learning, and for peer coaching and work scrutiny systems, which are now fully implemented. This has developed and supported the ongoing improvement of overall standards and development of staff.5.12Policies and procedures are monitored and evaluated regularly to ensure that content and implementation are secure. The process of self-evaluation is strong. This has resulted in the production of a comprehensive development plan that covers a breadth of areas including the identification of clear targets, the introduction of new initiatives and the implementation of a new programme to ensure the emotional well-being of the pupils and staff.5.13Other recent initiatives to improve teaching and learning are beginning to have a positive impact on the standards achieved by the pupils.

In particular, detailed systems for tracking individual pupils’ progress have been developed to ensure that the needs of every pupil are identified quickly and met successfully. Communication amongst all staff at the school is a strength; it is frequent and well focused, providing an excellent level of awareness of exactly what is needed to support each pupil.5.14The premises and grounds are well maintained and pupils respect their learning environment. The care and expertise of all those who work to support the pupils, through the administration, catering and maintenance departments, enable the school to run very effectively.5.15The school has developed very strong links with parents. In response to the questionnaire, parents expressed high levels of satisfaction with all aspects of the education and care their children receive and are very supportive of the school. Parents across the school particularly appreciate the individual care and attention their children receive, the range of the curriculum and subjects offered, and the Cheltenham College Preparatory School16 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2016quality and quantity of the information that is made available to them. This allows them to feel involved in their children’s education. Most parents would happily recommend the school to others.5.16In the EYFS, staff and parents work closely together to ensure that all children’s needs are met. Parents contribute to their children’s learning by providing information through ongoing verbal or written dialogue. Parents are kept well informed of their children’s progress; they receive written reports and are invited to formal meetings to discuss overall development. Effective partnerships with parents, together with consultation with external agencies and other professionals, secure appropriate interventions, as necessary.5.17There is excellent two-way communication between parents and the school. This includes daily contact in person, home contact books and prep diaries, email and text messages, detailed weekly newsletters and much useful up-to-date information that is easily accessible on the school’s website. Social media is used to convey daily messages and reminders, and to share good news stories. Staff, in all sections of the school, are available to speak to parents on request; the useful Lines of Communication guide assists parents in knowing to whom they should go and in what circumstances. Parents acknowledge that responses to their questions are timely; all but a very small minority are satisfied with the way in which the school has handled their concerns. The school’s complaints procedure, which is made openly available to parents, meets all regulatory requirements.5.18Information about school policies and other relevant documents is readily available to parents of both prospective and current pupils through the website. A comprehensive series of prospectuses, guides and promotional videos provides additional information about the school.5.19Parents and others have a range of opportunities to be involved in the work and progress of their children and to contribute to their education. For example, they share their experiences and expertise through classroom activities and through presentations on such subjects as Diwali and working in the medical profession through the Wednesday Wonder programme. Parents are always welcome to attend chapel services, assemblies, sports fixtures, plays, performances and other special occasions, such as Parents’ Day and Sports Day. The active Friends of the Prep group organises a number of fund-raising and social events for pupils and parents throughout the year. Any monies raised go towards the school’s chosen charity for the academic year.5.20Full written reports are issued at the end of the school year for all pupils from Nursery to Year 7.

Background Information About the school 1.1 Cheltenham College Preparatory School is an independent day and boarding school, for boys and girls, aged three to thirteen years. Founded in 1841, as part of Cheltenham College, it became a separate school in 1909. The pre-preparatory department opened in 1993, and the school became fully co- educational in 1998. Boarders are accommodated in a single boarding house that offers full, weekly and flexible boarding options. 1.2 The school is a registered charity, which is governed jointly with the senior school, under a single governing body named the Council. The head of the college has overall responsibility for both the senior and the preparatory schools. 1.3 A new preparatory head was appointed in 2018. What the school seeks to do 1.4 The school aims to equip pupils to lead fulfilled and purposeful lives, with a commitment to the service of others, by providing an excellent all-round education founded on Christian principles. It seeks to foster intellectual curiosity, academic rigour, independent learning and interests beyond the academic, which bring enjoyment and enrichment. About the pupils 1.5 Pupils come from a wide range of backgrounds, mainly living within a 20-mile radius of the school but also including some boarders from overseas. The school’s own assessment indicates that the ability of pupils is above average. The school has identified 82 pupils as being monitored for or having special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND), which include dyslexia, dyspraxia and specific learning difficulties, 43 of whom receive additional specialist help. One pupil has an education, health and care (EHC) plan. English is an additional language (EAL) for 31 pupils, of whom 15 are supported in this regard. Data used by the school have identified 46 pupils as being the most academically able in the school’s population, and the curriculum is modified for them, as well as for 70 other pupils because of their special talents in drama, art, music, design technology, computing and sport.

The Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) is the body approved by the Secretary of State for the purpose of inspecting schools which are, or whose heads are, in membership of the associations which form the Independent Schools Council (ISC) and reporting on the extent to which they meet the Independent School Standards (‘the standards’) in the Schedule to the Education (Independent School Standards) Regulations 2014. Accordingly, inspection records whether the school meets each of these standards, which are arranged in eight Parts, each of which is divided into separate paragraphs. The inspection of schools that have early years settings not requiring registration similarly records whether the school complies with key provisions of the Early Years Foundation Stage statutory framework, and for registered settings the full range of the Early Years Foundation Stage provisions is considered. Additionally, the inspection reports on the school’s accessibility plan under Schedule 10 of the Equality Act 2010 and the ban on corporal punishment under section 548 of the Education Act 1996. It comments on the progress made by the school in meeting the compliance action points set out in the school’s most recent statutory inspection. This inspection also contains specific judgements on the National Minimum Standards for Boarding Schools (‘boarding NMS’). It also comments on the progress made by the school in meeting the compliance action points set out in the most recent statutory boarding inspection and it judges the extent to which the school currently meets the boarding NMS. It identifies any standards which the school does not meet and requires action to meet them. Findings are distributed across sections relating to the eight Parts of the standards. All association independent schools will have an inspection within three years from April 2016, in accordance with the Framework and DfE requirements. The inspection may be of COMPLIANCE ONLY or a combined inspection of EDUCATIONAL QUALITY AND COMPLIANCE depending on a number of factors, including findings from their most recent inspection. Schools judged not to meet the standards, including the boarding NMS, may also be subject to a progress monitoring visit before their next routine inspection. The progress monitoring visit will judge whether the school has taken the necessary action to meet any un-met standards identified at their previous inspection. The inspection was also carried out under the arrangements of the ISC Associations for the maintenance and improvement of the quality of their membership. This is a COMPLIANCE ONLY inspection and as such reports only on the school’s compliance with the standards, including the boarding NMS. The standards represent minimum requirements and judgements are given either as met or as not met. All schools are required to meet all the standards applicable to them. Where the minimum requirements are not met, this is clearly indicated in the relevant section of the report and the school is required to take the actions specified. Inspections do not include matters that are outside of the regulatory framework described above, such as: an exhaustive health and safety audit; compliance with data protection requirements; an in-depth examination of the structural condition of the school, its services or other physical features; contractual arrangements with parents; an investigation of the financial viability of the school or its accounting procedures. Inspectors may be aware of individual safeguarding concerns, allegations and complaints as part of the inspection process. Such matters will not usually be referred to specifically in published reports in this document but will have been considered by the team in reaching its judgements.

Every child deserves their schooldays to be magical; something to be loved at the time and remembered fondly for years to come. It is not enough that schools simply prepare the children for the challenges that lie ahead. This is vitally important, of course, but it comes as a result of happy, engaged and challenged children throwing themselves into all that every day has to offer. Our job, as educators, is to inspire the children, to bring excitement and intrigue into every lesson. Having amazing facilities is wonderful, but it is the teacher in the classroom who can engage and motivate each child that really makes the difference. Everybody remembers the impact one particular teacher had on them, and the influence that inspirational teacher has had, often, over their whole life. And that is what life at Cheltenham Prep is all about! Life here is always interesting. Every day children have the opportunity to indulge new passions and interests, finding what they are brilliant at, and to learn how to overcome challenges, both inside and outside of the classroom. As a result, every child not only fulfils their potential but actually achieves above and beyond anything they ever thought they were capable of. We are lucky to have the facilities, small classes and resources that we do, but in the end it still comes down to the inspirational staff here, ensuring that your child receives an extraordinary education that will challenge them greatly but will also put a smile on their face and give them a million things to talk about when they get home. I very much look forward to welcoming you to The Prep. With very best wishes, Tom O’Sullivan The Prep Good Schools Guide In the Autumn Term of 2023, Good Schools Guide visited Cheltenham College and Cheltenham Prep.

Cheltenham is a vibrant and exciting school, with traditional values but a very modern approach. We pride ourselves on going beyond your expectations as a parent, in our support for your child. In doing so, we enable our pupils to achieve above their expectations of themselves. We consistently produce top academic performances thanks to our outstanding staff who are excited by their subjects and who find an innate joy in teaching. We are academically ambitious and our results speak for themselves. We have a fabulous track record for sport of all kinds too, from the mainstream to the less usual. Our approach is to open our pupils’ minds to trying new things and to being confident enough to make mistakes. There is something for everyone here and you may well wish your own school days were not behind you, once you have perused all that is on offer here. Our House system and pastoral care is exceptional and forms the cornerstone of all that we do. If you happen to ask any Cheltonian today, they will talk about the care and attention they receive from their House staff and tutor. We work hard to promote excellent relationships between pupils and staff. Our relaxed atmosphere fosters originality and creativity in both teaching and learning. This promotes agency – our pupils are encouraged to take owner ship of their own trajectory and in that way, we prepare them for the exciting world that awaits them when they finally leave school. We aim to go beyond acquaintances to friendships, beyond inclusion to belonging. Belonging is a two-way street. Your child belongs here and a part of here, will belong, for always and forever, to your child. That is the way that they form friendships that last a lifetime. Here, at Cheltenham College, there is room to make mistakes and space to put them right. We help to develop the always-valued all-rounder by encouraging pupils to do different things and to relish the variety that exists here. No two days are ever the same. We believe that when a child becomes good at one thing, they quickly become good at another, often unrelated thing. An applauded piano performance can boost a maths exam. A half century can improve an English essay. It is, of course, all about confidence.

No two days are ever the same. We believe that when a child becomes good at one thing, they quickly become good at another, often unrelated thing. An applauded piano performance can boost a maths exam. A half century can improve an English essay. It is, of course, all about confidence. Confidence to say ‘I can’. ‘I can have a go at that.’ This belief in yourself, and others’ belief in you, is what forms the whole. That is what education is all about. It is what shapes the trajectory of an entire life. And that is what Cheltenham College is all about too – a journey beyond and above. Do come and visit us soon.

The Sixth Form Experience Hear first hand from our Sixth Form pupils, as they share their experiences below. Meet Ngoni “I joined Cheltenham College in Third Form, having also been to Cheltenham Prep School. I chose College due the support that is given to help you strive in all areas, whether it is in academics, sports, music, drama and art. What drew me to College the most was the pastoral care . Being an international student, College truly does their best to make it a home away from home. Teachers have helped me the most academically by pushing me outside of my comfort zone to reach my fullest potential. Most importantly, academic societies are the best place to further your understanding by encouraging important discussions about the subjects and its influence in the modern world. It is also a great place to ask questions that you are unable to ask in a classroom environment.” Meet Ed “Since the age of three, I have been part of the College community, having been to The Prep. When looking at joining College, t he sport was really appealing to me, and the coaches at College made this decision even easier. Academics wise I knew that College had lots of options for GCSEs and A Levels. I am currently studying Sport Science, History, Business, and I completed the EPQ last year. When I leave College, I am going to be going to u niversity in the USA on a r ugby scholarship, and hopefully be part of something special at Lindenwood University, Missouri. Personally, I think the opportunities at College to try new things, meet new people, and make new connections is what makes it so special, and sets it apart from anywhere else.” Meet Grace “I joined Cheltenham College for Sixth Form, because I wanted a change from my previous school. With all on offer at College, it seemed like it would allow me to challenge myself and grow – as it has done. I am now studying Maths, Economics and Politics at A Level. The best thing about College to me is my boarding house. I may be biased but Chandos is the best, it feels more like a home and I will truly miss it when I leave. I have had a wonderful experience at College and I will be sad to leave.” Meet Ryan “I joined College in the Fourth Form, I was at an international school in Hong Kong before I joined College. When my parents and I were looking to study overseas, the spa town of Cheltenham really stood out to us with its regency architecture and unique scenery. The school itself also had a lot of features that stood out such as its facilities and its proximity to the town centre. I think the availability of your teachers and tutors has really supported me throughout college. You are always able to find a teacher in your subject within the department or within your boarding house to help you with whatever issues you have with your work. “ Why Study at Cheltenham College Sixth Form?

Please read on below for an overview of individual subjects. If you would like more information about the curriculum offered, please view the Sixth Form Curriculum booklet linked here. FAQs: A Levels, BTECs and CTechs What is a BTEC and CTech and how do they differ to A levels? CTechs (Cambridge Technical Extended Certificates) and BTECs (Business and Technology Education Council) are both vocational Level 3 qualifications. A Levels are also Level 3 qualifications. CTechs and BTECS differ to A Levels in that they are taught and assessed using different methods. Whereas most A Levels are assessed at the end of the two year course with several examinations in the summer of Upper Sixth, CTechs and BTECs are assessed throughout the course, with a large coursework element making up the final mark. What is the difference between a BTEC and CTech ? Both are graded via the same grading system: Distinction*; Distinction; Merit; Pass. The reason for some subjects being called BTECs and others CTechs is simply the different exam boards; BTECs are taken with Pearson, Cambridge Technicals with OCR. What CTechs and BTECs do you offer? College offers CTechs in Business, Sport and Physical Activity and Information Technology and a BTEC in Applied Psychology. What are the benefits of a CTech or BTEC? CTechs and BTECs are assessed via both coursework and exams, with the coursework element carrying around 60-70% of the final mark, so they suit those who might find 100% exam qualifications challenging. CTech and BTEC modular assessments can be retaken at a later date to improve the grade a student achieves. CTechs and BTECs have no official GCSE grade requirements. Courses tend to be finished by the Spring Term, enabling students to focus on Upper Sixth summer exams in other subjects. Students who take CTechs and BTECs will often achieve higher grades (or UCAS points) than if they were to take the equivalent A Level subject. Why should my child do a CTech or BTEC and not an A Level? If your child has done particularly well in a coursework GCSE subject or finds subjects based entirely on exams challenging, they may be suited to the coursework and modular assessment format of BTECs and CTechs. Also, if your child isn’t expected to achieve the required GCSE grades to access the A Level courses, they may wish to consider a BTEC or CTech. It is worth noting that the modular assessment and coursework element of BTECs and CTechs do require motivation and organisation as there are numerous submission deadlines throughout the"}

If your child has done particularly well in a coursework GCSE subject or finds subjects based entirely on exams challenging, they may be suited to the coursework and modular assessment format of BTECs and CTechs. Also, if your child isn’t expected to achieve the required GCSE grades to access the A Level courses, they may wish to consider a BTEC or CTech. It is worth noting that the modular assessment and coursework element of BTECs and CTechs do require motivation and organisation as there are numerous submission deadlines throughout the course. How are BTECs and CTechs assessed? These qualifications are assessed through both coursework elements, completed throughout Upper College and with advice and support from teachers, and by external exams. Many pupils find this consistent and supported method of assessment better suits their style of working than traditional A Levels which are more reliant on a final exam after two years. Do they have exams? Yes, this is a recent change and now all BTECs and CTechs include exams. The weighting of these exams is smaller in the overall qualification due to a significant amount of coursework that pupils complete. The exams also differ from A Levels in that they are modular, meaning that they can be sat at different points in the course and retaken for a better result if required; at College, for example, many pupils take at least one module in January of Lower Sixth, with a resit opportunity in June. Who teaches these qualifications? Pupils are taught by the same members of staff who teach A Levels and GCSEs if offered by their departments, offering the same level of superb subject knowledge and understanding of the course they deliver. How many CTechs or BTECs should you do? At the time of writing, there are over 160 universities in the UK. For some of the top universities that accept vocational qualifications, there is a preference for applicants to have only one CTech or BTEC qualification alongside two A Levels. For the majority of higher education institutions in the UK, however, a student will be considered with any combination of A levels, CTechs or BTECs. Can you apply to Russell Group universities with a CTech or BTEC? At the time of writing, you can apply to Russell Group universities with a CTech or BTEC, although some will require an applicant to have two A Level qualifications alongside it. Although the higher education landscape is constantly changing, last year College students taking CTechs (College only offered BTECs from Sept 2022) received offers from Cardiff University, University of Exeter, Newcastle University, University of Liverpool and University of Leeds. Our advice is always to check with individual institutions about their entry requirements. Do all UK Universities accept CTechs and BTECs? Some top tier UK institutions, Imperial College London for example, do not accept vocational qualifications as they are not deemed academically rigorous enough. Others, such as Oxford, Cambridge, and the London School of Economics, place tight requirements on combining vocational qualifications with A Levels. Most other universities in the UK do accept at least one BTEC or CTech, although our advice is always to check with individual institutions about their entry requirements. For some courses, the content of the BTEC and CTech qualification does not cover what is required for some university admissions, so for example, Applied Psychology BTEC does not contain sufficient science content to apply for BSc (Hons) Psychology at the University of Bristol, whereas the A Level in Psychology does. Again, our advice is to check with individual institutions. Please be aware that most European universities (and some US and Australian universities) will not accept vocational courses such as BTECs and CTechs. Pupils are asked to check with individual international universities to understand their entry requirements. How many UCAS points is a CTech or BTEC worth? Some universities require grades for entry (from A Levels for example), and some universities require UCAS points which can be accrued from sixth form studies, EPQ, dance, drama and music exams etc. CTechs and BTECs carry UCAS points in the same way that A Levels do.

Distinction* (the highest grade that can be achieved with these qualifications) gives pupils 56 UCAS points. Distinction gives pupils 48 UCAS points. Merit gives pupils 32 UCAS points. Pass gives pupils 16 UCAS points. It is worth noting, that when calculating grade equivalents, some universities equate the Distinction to a B grade. So, for example, if a university requires BBB, they may make an offer of Distinction, B, B, even though the points equivalent equates it to an A grade. As before, our advice is always to check with individual institutions about their entry requirements.

The department has purpose built offices, a meeting room, and a specialist library of resources – based next to the main Library. With a Sixth Form of over 300 pupils, Cheltenham College handles a large and diverse range of university, apprenticeship and employment applications and has a great deal of experience (and success) in placing pupils at their first choice destination. Which universities and courses do our pupils progress to? Below shows the higher education courses our pupils have chosen in order of popularity over the last few years.

Successful applicants have recently read for degrees in Mathematics, Modern Languages, Classics and Natural Sciences. A pupil’s pathway to Oxbridge begins well in advance of their entrance to the Sixth Form, when they are able attend a range of subject specific societies targeted at academic enrichment. In the Lower Sixth, each pupil is paired with an experienced academic mentor (usually the Head of Department in their chosen area of study) who will help them prepare for entrance tests and expand their understanding beyond the confines of the curriculum. We encourage pupils to read widely around their chosen area of study and will take part in competitions of national and international significance, both as markers of their academic excellence and in support of their application. A dedicated Oxbridge Coordinator is on hand to guide pupils through the application process and will meet regularly with pupils both as a group and in bespoke, targeted, one to one sessions. Oxbridge Timeline Fifth Form Oxbridge preparation begins in Fifth Form. Pupils with particularly strong academic credentials are identified and encouraged to attend Lower College Society to broaden their academic profile, develop their curiosity and inspire them to consider high ranking institutions at Higher Education level. Lower Sixth Form - Autumn Term In Autumn term of Lower Sixth, we offer two external talks from Old Cheltonians at Oxbridge for those pupils who have achieved the requisite GCSE grades (predominantly G9, and G8) and fulfil the necessary academic profile. We also attend a Q&A insight session with Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford’s undergraduates, and admission tutors. Lower Sixth Form – Spring Term From January at the start of the Spring Term of Lower Sixth, pupils are invited to join the Oxbridge programme for that year. Weekly group sessions to determine which pathway is better for the pupil, and which courses they are interested in. Pupils will be encouraged to extend themselves beyond the A Level curriculum in their chosen field of interest by attending external enrichment events, entering national competitions, and independently researching and presenting papers to College societies. Pupils are given a grounding in critical thinking skills, which are needed to pave the way to Oxbridge success, particularly at interview. Lower Sixth Form - Summer Term Applicants are paired with a subject specific mentor (a HoD or trained member of department) who will encourage further reading, discussion and work beyond the A Level syllabus – helping to prepare for pre-admissions tests and for writing their application.

Our House structure, school life and routines have been developed so that all of our pupils can play a full part in life at College. We have 11 Houses at College, including two dedicated Day Houses. In all other Houses, a maximum of 25% of any Year group in a House may be Day Boarders, so that we retain our rich and vibrant full boarding ethos in the evenings and at weekends. All of the college Houses are located around the perimeter of the campus. Discover more about the different Day and boarding options in our House & Home brochure below, or click here to learn more about the different Houses. You can choose from three different options for your child. As a Full Boarder As a Day Boarder As a Day Pupil Your child will live in their Boarding House during term time and return home to you during the holidays and agreed weekends. The full boarding principle is that your child will spend more time boarding in College than at home during term time. Your child will be part of a Boarding House, have their own bed and use its facilities during their days here. They are expected to stay a minimum of two nights per week but are encouraged to stay more. The fee covers 35 nights each term, and there is a charge for every night in addition to this. A maximum of 25% of any Year group in a House may be Day Boarders, so that we retain our rich and vibrant full boarding ethos in the evenings and at weekends. “Flexi-boarding places (minimum two nights but most stay all week) like gold-dust – ‘We all want them!’ admitted local parent.” – Good Schools Guide, 2023 Your son or daughter will be part of a House and use its facilities during their days here. Day pupils are just as much a part of House life as Boarders and have the option to take part in the same activities with the exception of the overnight stay. If required, they may also stay on the odd occasion, on specific nights agreed with the Housemaster or Housemistress which would need to be booked in advance and is dependent on whether there is space available.

We have 11 Houses: six boys’ Houses and five girls’ Houses. All are located around the perimeter of the campus. Please click on the coloured logos below to access a tour of each of our Houses. Each House is led by a Housemaster or Housemistress who is resident in the House, something that helps to create a warm, family environment. They are supported by a team of resident and non-resident tutors and matrons. Every House is a small, close-knit community and has a distinctive character all of its own. Each House has an equal amount of year groups within it, with pupils of all ages socialising, mentoring and supporting each other throughout College life. This creates an environment that alleviates homesickness and encourages strong friendships while also fostering a deep sense of House honour and loyalty. Choosing the right House for your child is an important decision and one that we will be happy to advise on. As a rule of thumb, if you have a strong House preference, you are advised to register it at least four years before your child enters the school. House allocations are not confirmed until after the offer of a place has been made in November of Year 6. Resident house staff, especially houseparents, raved about – ‘These people have been so important in my children’s lives,’ said one parent, dewy-eyed. ‘And they’re lots of fun too,’ reckoned our guides.

Brooksmithites know that effort brings reward and are expected to implement this in all areas of College life, as well as getting out of their comfort zones by trying new things like the Three Peaks Challenge, hill walking, taking part in the Devizes to Westminster International Canoe Race and being involved with charity initiatives, in particular, the James Hopkins Trust based in Gloucester, and the hosting of the Afghan Refugee Cricket Project on their annual tour. Chandos Chandos Chandos is the oldest girls’ Boarding House at College and has expanded from eight Sixth Form girls in 1981 to 80 girls today, from the Third Form right through to the Upper Sixth. Housemaster Mr Alex Henocq believes in Boarding House family that includes and values everyone as an individual and encourages working together as a community. High standards of behaviour are expected and Chandos girls are always striving to develop their personal skills, interests and talents. Every girl within Chandos has her role to play in making the House a very happy and successful place. Part of the House are the Chandos Cottages alongside the main Boarding House. The older girls live here in an environment designed to nurture independence and prepare them for life away from home in Higher Education. Chandos Cottages are overseen by an Assistant Housemistress and Resident Tutor, who ensure that whilst they live in this unique setting, the girls still remain engaged with Chandos House life. Alex joined Chandos as Housemaster in September 2024, having had almost 20 years’ experience in both the state and independent sector. Prior to his move to Cheltenham, Alex was Housemaster at a large girls’ boarding house in a school is West Sussex. He is a keen sportsman, coaching rugby and basketball and teaches Chemistry at College. Alex is joined by his wife Mary and their son Luca who cannot wait to take part in the daily fun that the House has to offer. At weekends the girls enjoy a variety of activities in addition to those organised by College. These include visits to theme parks, the cinema, canoeing, horse riding, ice skating and cooking. Christowe Christowe Christowe thrives on its keen sense of tradition and history. The House emblem is the Royal Lancers’ skull and cross bones and it originates from the Duke of Cambridge’s cavalry regiment of the British Army. The House moved into the current building in 1866 under the Housemastership of the Reverend William Boyce; who named Christowe after the village in Devon where he married. In recognition of Reverend Boyce, ‘Boyceites’ is the name given to all members of the House.

Dan lives in Christowe with his wife Harriet, who is a Religious Studies Teacher. College Lawn College Lawn College Lawn is the newest House at College, formed in September 2017. Having been built as a family home, the House retains a sense of warmth and informality and this is something Housemistress Caroline Kirby is keen to foster. The ethos of College Lawn is very much one of friendship, kindness and fun. As with all Houses, there are girls in House who excel in all areas of College life, but College Lawn’s greatest strength is in pulling together, whether that be for House Singing, House Pots or fundraising for College or the House charity. Caroline is also a Geography teacher at College and her husband, Robert is a tutor in College Lawn and a Modern Foreign Languages teacher. Caroline is also supported by Mr Pirttijarvi, the Assistant Housemaster, Mrs McBride as resident tutor and a team of outstanding tutors and matrons. The College Lawn team work hard to ensure that all College Lawn girls develop as well-rounded, kind, thoughtful and ambitious young women. Hazelwell Hazelwell Established in 1866 by its first Housemaster Mr Green, Hazelwell boys are named ‘Greenites’ after the founder of the boarding house. Situated in the fabulous Victorian family home on College Road, Hazelwell has a rich history of educating young men. Whilst maintaining some of the great house traditions, Hazelwell aims to provide a modern approach to boarding that seeks to replicate the family atmosphere of a home. It is a thriving community where relationships are familiar in nature and the environment relaxed and stable. Whilst College life builds knowledge, provides opportunities and opens doors, the caring and nurturing environment of Hazelwell builds confidence and encourages boys to get outside of their comfort zones and participate in what is on offer. The House emblem is a red dragon. Throughout history the dragon has been a symbol of strength, power and passionate heroism with some cultures associating it with good fortune and spiritual well-being. The Hazelwell boys take this ‘Dragon Spirit’ into all parts of College life. They are balanced all-rounders who are confident to take on challenges and aspire to success. Paul Hayes joined College from Holyport College in Berkshire where he was Housemaster of the boys’ house and a member of the Senior Leadership Team in charge of both boarding and pastoral care. Mr Hayes is an English teacher and a keen sportsman. Paul is joined in Hazelwell by his wife Alex and their three young children, After commissioning from Sandhurst, Alex spent six years in the Royal Artillery. She now works as a manager for the NHS and is a serving Magistrate for the Gloucestershire Bench. Leconfield Leconfield Leconfield is a Boarding House that prides itself on being a warm, friendly and purposeful place to live. By encouraging each boy to contribute to its community through positive communication, diligence and an innate playfulness, all boys quickly become part of the Porcherite (as Leconfield boys are known) family and look out for each other throughout College life. Leconfield was part of the second wave of Boarding Houses to be developed at College in the late 1860s along with Hazelwell, Cheltondale and Christowe. Its place at the heart of College for over 150 years means Leconfield has enjoyed much success in House competitions; a tradition that today’s boys are keen to maintain.

They have two young boys, Hector and Tobias, who are a part of Leconfield life. Daniel joined College in 2013 as Deputy Head of Upper College. He teaches History and History of Art and prior to joining College he was Head of History of Art and Architecture at Wycombe Abbey School. He considers it a great honour to be running a House with such a rich history. Along with support staff, they all help to make Leconfield a home from home for Porcherites and a lively place on the weekends, with many activities on offer after school finishes for the week. Indoor climbing, water activities, paintballing, skiing, theatre and museum visits are just some of the things Porcherites can enjoy during the year. Newick House Newick House Newick House boys or ‘Muglistonites’, named after Newick House’s longest serving Housemaster Reverend John Mugliston, are well-rounded individuals who are fiercely loyal to the house. Newick House provides a place for pupils to become independent individuals in a supportive family environment, with the ultimate aim to create accomplished young men fully prepared for life after College. Muglistonites are particularly encouraged to participate fully in school life by involving themselves in the multitude of activities that are offered by College. No more is this the case than in House competitions where Newick House boys pride themselves on giving their all and enjoying considerable success. The Newick House tutor team are integral in helping boys fulfil their academic potential whilst still participating fully in all other areas. Alex Naylor joined as Housemaster of Newick House in August 2024. He is joined in the house by his wife Sophie, and spaniel Tiki. Alex is an Art Teacher at College and passionate about art, the outdoors, hiking and cycling. The Queen's House The Queen’s House Queen’s House has been a College Girls’ Day House since 2002. It is a stunning Georgian building, beautifully situated overlooking the main College Field and Chapel, and aims to create a homely and welcoming atmosphere. Day girls thrive in this environment and are as involved as Boarders in College life, fully participating in all activities on offer. Queen’s girls can stay overnight in the Queen’s dormitory to support their busy College life. Although it is a Day House, Queen’s runs like a boarding house, giving the girls the option to go home or stay late for evening prep, supervised by a Tutor on duty. Wandrille Bates is a French teacher at Cheltenham College and has been the Queen’s Housemistress since 2010. Her husband Will, teaches Geography and is the Resident Tutor. Wandrille is supported in running Queen’s by a team of fantastic Tutors, and Matron. They strongly believe in the all round ethos of the school and ensure that each day girl finds her niche, as well as steps out of her comfort zone. The staff in Queen’s promote independence, respect and a sense of belonging to all the girls, and organise many events focusing on team spirit and genuine fun. Queen’s prides itself on its inclusion and friendship across all year groups. This family spirit continues beyond College, as many leavers come back to visit. Southwood Southwood Southwood is a boys’ Day House that opened in 1975 and is situated at the heart of the College grounds.

Southwood Southwood Southwood is a boys’ Day House that opened in 1975 and is situated at the heart of the College grounds. The House is open from 7.00am until the last boy goes home, enabling them to take part in a broad range of academic and co-curricular activities that may well take place long after the normal school day has finished. The House also has a bedroom that is able to accommodate two Southwood boys overnight should the need arise due to an early or late College activity . Many boys take the opportunity to get some prep (homework) done in the House during the day, freeing them up to relax at home in the evening. Some, however, stay on to do prep, having had supper with the Boarders at College, before being picked up later on in the evening. Southwood is the boys’ second home and as such Housemaster James Orchard fosters a warm, family-orientated atmosphere where the boys feel comfortable and most importantly, happy. When they are happy they are more able to excel in everything else they do in and around College. The boys are proud of their House and celebrate the broad range of talents that you find within a Day House community. Westal Westal Westal is a relaxing home for girls at College, nestled by the greenery of the sports pitches. It is blessed with lovely, light facilities that create a wonderful environment in which to work and play. Whether your child is dramatic, sporty, academic, musical or of course a combination of these, she will find in Westal like-minded spirits with whom she can share her passions. Westal’s Housemaster is Tim Lang and together with a team of House tutors he fosters a sense of family, leadership and participation within Westal. The elder girls within the House look out for and guide the younger members of the group and everyone is involved in House decisions, including how the House is run and which activities to undertake together during weekends. Leadership skills are encouraged and developed within Westal girls so they can achieve both during their time at College and in the world beyond it. One of the many highlights of the week in Westal is the House coming together to celebrate the numerous achievements of its girls within whatever sphere they choose to excel in.

There is a full activities programme during the week including sports, music, drama, service options, societies and clubs for all pupils to engage with; all are available to all regardless of experience or skill level. Cheltonians engage in a hugely positive and encouraging way to all that is offered outside the classroom. In addition to the sport, music, drama and Community Action, we are hugely proud of our Combined Cadet Force and how it allows pupils to develop their leadership skills. Our Duke of Edinburgh programme spans the full spectrum from the Bronze to Gold Award, with pupils rising to the challenges that Snowdonia and the Lake District throws at them. Our Wednesday afternoon, ‘Third Form Challenge’ programme, integrates pupils to College and allows them to quickly make friends with others in the year group. Finally, our Monday afternoon activities programme offers pupils the opportunity to join various clubs, ranging from cooking to books, debating to music technology, language film club to squash and much more besides. Our co-curricular provision aims to complement life in the classroom; it is about challenge, determination, the ability to bounce back when one fails and to realise the reward of hard work and effort; lessons in life which will serve Cheltonians well long after they have left College. My favourite thing about College is the wide range of co-curricular opportunities available. For example, everyone does timetabled sport at least three times a week, and this has introduced me to many new sports. There is also a fantastic Music Department with many opportunities to join ensembles and perform alongside others in concerts. There is also a wide range of other activities ranging from cooking club to CCF. Current pupil, 2025 Activities & Societies Academic societies and practical activity clubs allow pupils to open up areas of interest and develop new skills outside the classroom environment.

The Combined Cadet Force sees pupils become part of the Army contingent. As a cadet, pupils undertake exciting and adventurous pursuits that help them to develop leadership skills, teamwork and confidence that will stand them in good stead in their school lives and beyond. Training takes place every Wednesday afternoon at College and is led by qualified staff, a number of whom have had previous careers in the armed forces. It is supported by field days, a week-long camp and opportunities to attend courses during which cadets spend longer periods of time working towards recognised qualifications.

Drama is a popular activity at College and pupils put on at least six productions a year, including House plays. Pupils have the opportunity to perform onstage or be part of the backstage team developing skills in lighting, sound, stage management and more. Pupils who are part of a production are given protected time, with three sessions a week dedicated to rehearsal and performance. This approach gives pupils space to focus on the production but also ensures that academic studies are not neglected. One of the biggest joys of College productions is that it allows pupils to perform in front of sold-out audiences of peers, parents and staff in our theatre, Big Classical, which is one of College’s original buildings.

Although I am only in my second year, I was granted the opportunity at the end of Third Form to apply for an exchange to an American school and was lucky enough to be selected through a process of application and interviews. This preparation was a great insight to what application in further years will be like. It was the most invigorating experience I have gone through but it would not have been possible without the support I had from staff and pupils. Many opportunities like this are available during College which are perfect for those looking for an academic stretch. “ Meet Lewis “Cheltenham College has provided me with a fantastic mix of competitive sporting opportunities. Although tennis is my main sport and I compete at national level, College has meant I could also continue playing hockey and rackets competitively. The rackets tournament at Queen’s Club London is a privilege to take part in. The time and enthusiasm staff give us is amazing and they make it possible to pursue your personal ambitions.” Meet Yoyo “The College and the Art Department have been instrumental in supporting my artistic journey and inspiring my ideas for the future. They offer a rich environment of mentorship and resources. From the Art Studio, to experienced faculty who nurture creativity, I am constantly encouraged to explore new mediums and push the boundaries of my skills. Their continuous support enables me to dedicate more time to my art. I have always worked hard at art and have a deep love for it. I actively participate in various activities and spend my free time in the Art Studio. At College, the main art room feels like my second home. Over the years at College, I have not only enjoyed creating art but also cherished being part of this supportive and loving community.” Meet Maisy “It is a joy to be able to collaborate with all year groups in such a creative way when putting on a production, and at College there are so many opportunities for this – from House plays to Whole School productions. There has been a huge variety of choice, whether it is a serious play like Lord of the Flies, or an upbeat musical such as Grease, there is something for everyone. Being part of the Drama Department has given me the opportunity to attend workshops with industry professionals, perform at the Playhouse Theatre in Cheltenham and trips to watch professional shows at The Everyman. Having a drama award allows me to have weekly LAMDA lessons, in which you can work up to the highest Grade 8 or beyond to Diploma with the amazing team.” Meet Curtis “Being a Music Award Holder at Cheltenham College has given me the opportunity to explore and develop my musical interests, both old and new. The range of musical opportunities has allowed me to grow in every aspect of my music career. Whilst being a scholar comes with high expectations; it is also incredibly rewarding. I have had the privilege of performing in a variety of concerts and events, from the Jazz Festival in Montpellier to an unforgettable jazz evening at The Elms. These experiences not only helped me refine my skills but also strengthened my bond with fellow musicians, creating a supportive and inspiring community within the College. Through dedication and commitment, I have been given incredible opportunities such as recitals and ensemble solos – nothing compares to the thrill of standing before an audience, pouring my heart into a saxophone solo.” Hear from a Sixth Form Scholar Hear from a Sixth Form Scholar Boarding at Cheltenham College Boarding at Cheltenham College Co-curricular Opportunities Co-curricular Opportunities The Prep The College Vacancies Prospectus Aims & Policies Public Benefit Term Dates Privacy & Terms Modern Slavery Statement Sitemap © 2025 Cheltenham College.

All pupils at The Prep have an opportunity to have an annual taster day at College from Year 4 onwards, this helps when the children move up to Year 9 at the end of their Prep School journey. We encourage our Prep School parents to visit College before their child moves up, and you can arrange a tour or join a Small Group Visit on a Saturday morning through our College Visits Team on visits@cheltenhamcollege.org . “Definitely one of the best boarding schools in the UK, especially for military families! Our son was at The Prep boarding from Year 3 and he is now at the College and our daughter started in Year 4 and is loving it…the school focuses on growth mindset in a huge way and the staff are incredibly supportive. As a family, we love Cheltenham Prep and the boarding house has a fantastic ‘home away from home’ environment – highly recommend to any military family looking for that ‘forever school’ for their children” Current parent FAQs What happens if my child is missing home? At some point every child misses home. The Boarding House staff are very experienced in supporting children who feel like this. After a chat with House staff and their friends in House and a busy weekly schedule, they soon feel better. What happens if my child is unwell or needs to attend regular medical appointments? We have a Health Centre on campus with Nurses, Mental Health Practitioners and two GPs. For external hospital or dental appointments, a member of staff can chaperone your child. Our Health Centre How do parents stay informed about how their child is getting on? You are welcome to contact the Boarding House at any point on prep.boarding@cheltenhamcollege.org There is a weekly newsletter, ‘Prep Connected’ emailed to parents every Friday afternoon, and this includes highlights from the past seven days across The Prep community. Our Instagram accounts, @cheltprep and @cadehousecc are updated weekly and are a great way of seeing what the boarders are up to! How are boarders supported with homework? All homework is finished either during the school day or in after school clubs. However, if children need extra help with their homework, Cheltenham College staff are always happy to support them. What is the after school routine in the Prep School Boarding House? At 5pm, children sign into House and change into home clothes, put any uniform/sports kit in the laundry and then enjoy some down time: playing games, relaxing in their dorms, playing outside. After-school clubs take place between 5pm and 6pm, followed by supper (6pm) and a House meeting (6.45pm). On Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Music practice takes place for those who play an instrument (6.45pm – 7.15pm).

Boarders can use their device every evening between 7pm – 8pm. We advise parents to select two weeknights as check in nights, however boarders can call parents to celebrate successes or to talk something through whenever they happen. Children must only be on the school Wifi, and we have a no social media policy (excluding WhatsApp). How do you manage international time difference? Boarders are able to collect their phone from Matron throughout the day if parents are in a different time zone. For example, at breaktime, children can collect their phone to chat with their parents and family. Do you take childcare vouchers for Prep School boarding? Yes.

{"url": "https://cheltenham-college.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/08143223/Attendance-and-Registration-Policy-C.pdf", "text": "Attendance and Registration Policy Reviewer: Paul Hayes Approver: Michelle Lucas-Halliwell Reviewed: September 2025 Next Review: May 2026 Introduction We aim for an environment which enables and encourages all members of the community to reach out for excellence. To do this it is crucial that every child attend College every day and on time. Our ambition is for all students to strive for 100% attendance. We set expectations of excellent attendance for all pupils and expect pupils to be in school every session and every day that school is open. We consider this paramount to pupils achieving their full potential and enhancing lifelong outcomes. Our Attendance Policy reflects this and recognises that regular attendance has a positive effect on the motivation and attainment of pupils and is an integral part of our school ethos. Some pupils find it harder than others to attend school and therefore at all stages of improving attendance we will work together with parents/carers, pupils and relevant partner agencies to remove barriers and build strong and trusting relationships. Aims and ethos Cheltenham College will act early to address any patterns of irregular attendance aiming to create a culture in which the importance of good school attendance is understood, valued, and supported by all. This policy sets out our school’s position on attendance and details the procedures that all parents1 must follow to report their child’s absence from school and to remind them of their legal duty, to ensure their child attends school regularly. This policy will be applied fairly and consistently, considering the individual needs of our pupils and their families who may have specific barriers to attendance. We have considered our obligations under the Equality Act 2010 and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Why regular attendance is so important Any absence affects the pattern of a student’s learning and regular absence will seriously affect their progress. Any student’s absence disrupts teaching routines and so may affect the learning of others in the same class. Evidence shows pupils with excellent school attendance are more likely to reach higher standards of achievement and be at less risk of exposure to crime and other safeguarding risks. 1 Education law defines parents as: all natural parents, whether they are married or not; any person who has parental responsibility for a child or young person; and any person who has day to day care of a child or young person i.e., lives with and looks after the child. In this policy the term ‘parent’ includes parents and carers. Ensuring a child’s regular attendance at College is a parent’s legal responsibility and permitting absence from College without a good reason is an offence in law and may result in prosecution. Every student should aim to have a minimum of 95% attendance. Anything less than this will impact on their education, as demonstrated in Table 1. Table 1 – The impact of attendance % on the number of school days/lessons missed. Safeguarding and Attendance Cheltenham College will monitor trends and patterns of absence for all pupils as a part of our standard procedures. However, we are aware that sudden or gradual changes in a pupil’s attendance may indicate additional or more extreme safeguarding issues. In line with government guidance Working Together to Improve School Attendance, August 2024 and Keeping Children Safe in Education 2024 we will investigate and report any suspected safeguarding cases to our local safeguarding partnership. Using data to support improvements in attendance Any absence affects the pattern of a child’s schooling and regular absence may seriously affect their learning. The Department for Education defines a pupil as a ‘persistent absentee’ when they miss 10% or more schooling across the school year, for whatever reason. For pupils who miss more than 50% of possible sessions they are defined as ‘severely absent’. The school will ensure that data is routinely monitored to identify emerging attendance issues and will seek to prevent any pupil becoming persistently or severely absent. This will include identifying the individual needs of pupils; working closely with families and wider support services to remove barriers to attendance; and where a formalised approach in conjunction with the local authority.

This will include identifying the individual needs of pupils; working closely with families and wider support services to remove barriers to attendance; and where a formalised approach in conjunction with the local authority. Persistent Absence (PA) A student becomes a ‘persistent absentee’ when they miss 10% of lessons across the College year for whatever reason. Absence at this level is doing considerable damage to any child’s educational prospects and should be treated as a safeguarding issue. We therefore need parents’ full support and co-operation to tackle this. PA students, and those at risk of becoming PA are tracked and monitored carefully through our pastoral system and we also combine this with academic mentoring where absence affects attainment. For pupils who miss 15 days or more in a row, even when absence has been explained through illness, we will refer to the Early Help team and if necessary complete a TALC referral. The attached appendix gives a summary of the stages and steps the College will take with persistent absentees. Promoting regular attendance Helping to create a pattern of regular attendance is everybody’s responsibility – parent/ guardian/carers, students, and all members of College staff. To help us all to focus on this the College will: • Give details on attendance on request. • Report to parents each half term regarding their child’s attendance and punctuality where it as fallen below a concerning level as determined in Appendix One. Understanding types of absence Every half-day absence from College must be classified by the College (not by the parent / carers), as either AUTHORISED or UNAUTHORISED. Therefore, information about the cause of any absence is always required, preferably in writing. Authorised absences are mornings or afternoons away from College for a good reason like illness, medical/dental appointments or extra-curricular activities which unavoidably fall in College time, emergencies, or other unavoidable cause. Unauthorised absences are those which the College does not consider reasonable and for which no “leave\" has been given. This type of absence is often asked for in educational references and in extreme circumstances – missing 10 registration contact points without explanation – may have to be reported to the Local Education Authority or the UKVI. Examples include: • Parents/carers keeping children off College unnecessarily • Truancy during the College day • Absences which are not properly explained • Any event in term time which have not been agreed. Whilst any child may be off College because they are ill, sometimes they can be reluctant to attend College. In this situation it is essential that the parents do not give in to pressure and allow students to stay away from College. This gives the impression that attendance does not matter and usually make things worse. The College works to support parent / carers to ensure that the child returns to College. If a pupil is ill for 5 days in a row and no Doctor’s note is provided, this will be classed as unauthorised absence and could trigger a report to LEA or UKVI. Absence Procedures If a child is absent parents must: • Contact Housemaster/ House Mistress or Duty matron as soon as possible on the first day of absence. • If the absence is ongoing due to illness or other circumstances, parents must continue to notify college and where appropriate supply medical notes. • Parents should always try to make appointments outside of school hours wherever possible. Where appointments during school time are urgent or unavoidable, the pupil should only be out of school for the minimum amount of time necessary for the appointment. It is not acceptable for a child to miss a whole day of schooling for an appointment, unless absolutely necessary. • If pupils are at risk of becoming persistently absent, parents should Proactively engage with the support offered by college to prevent the need for more"}

Where appointments during school time are urgent or unavoidable, the pupil should only be out of school for the minimum amount of time necessary for the appointment. It is not acceptable for a child to miss a whole day of schooling for an appointment, unless absolutely necessary. • If pupils are at risk of becoming persistently absent, parents should Proactively engage with the support offered by college to prevent the need for more formal support. Long term absence and Irregular attendance Cheltenham College has a duty to notify the Local Authority of cases of irregular attendance and continuous absence, specifically: • 10 days continuous absence (including if the child is likely to be absent for more than 15 days due to illness/injury) • Irregular attendance or regular absence where attendance is not improving despite ongoing school intervention. • Where a part time timetable or an Individual Welfare Plan has failed, and attendance has not improved or has deteriorated further (previous Part-Time Timetable notifications should have been submitted). Contact details There are times when we need to contact parents about lots of things, including absence, so we need to have accurate contact details and numbers at all times. Please ensure the College is informed immediately of any changes. There will be regular checks on telephone numbers throughout the year. Lateness Poor punctuality is not acceptable. Students who are late disrupt their own progress and the learning of others. How we manage lateness: Tutor time – unless at an authorised activity or appointment pupils are expected to be registered by their tutor at 8:30 If a pupil is persistently late, then the pupil will be required to attend a meeting with their Housemaster or Mistress to discuss the reasons for their lateness. If there is no improvement, then this will be escalated to the Assistant Head (Pastoral) and appropriate sanctions applied. At 9.05am the registers will be closed, and College Office will send around the registration report to Tutors and Houses. Holidays in term time Taking holidays in term time will affect a pupil’s schooling as much as any other absence and we expect parents to help us by not to take children away in College time. There is no automatic entitlement in law to time off in College time to go on holiday. Holiday absences may be authorised in exceptional circumstances. Any application for leave must be made in advance to the Housemaster or Housemistress. In making a decision, the College will consider the circumstances of each application individually, including any previous pattern of leave in term time and your child’s overall attendance record. Circumstances where such leave will be authorised: Leave will not be authorised unless the reason is considered an exceptional circumstance such as those outlined below: • Weddings of parents and siblings. • The funeral of a parent or sibling or any other compassionate incident • Where an absence from College is recommended by a health professional as part of a parent or child’s rehabilitation from a medical or emotional issue. A health professional’s letter will need to be seen by the HsM. • If a parent is service personnel and is returning from a tour of duty abroad where it is evidenced the individual will not be in receipt of any leave in the near future that coincides with college holidays. • Early departure of pupils due to personal reasons • Religious holidays • Passport and visa Interviews However, this list is not exhaustive. Recording Attendance For all day pupils of compulsory school age, the attendance register must be completed at the start of each morning session and once during each afternoon session using the electronic MIS (iSAMS). It must show whether the pupil is: The following DfE codes used to record attendance Registration procedures When taking a register tutors and classroom teachers should call each name and code as follows: / – Present N – Not present (No reason yet provided for absence) – Tutors/Teachers must press the alert button on ISAMs. Teachers/Tutors should not override any codes that"}

Statistical Meaning This code is classified for statistical purposes as attending an approved education activity Safeguarding Schools have responsibilities for the safeguarding and welfare of pupils attending an approved educational activity and will need to be satisfied that appropriate measure have been taken to safeguard the pupil. Absence Schools should ensure that arrangements are in place whereby the provider of the approved activity notifies the school of any absence by the pupil. The school must record the pupil’s absence using the relevant absence code. Further information Schools must also record the nature of the educational activity When to use this code This code should be used for pupils who are present at educational provision which is not in a school such as a taster day at another school. Registration Code C Description Other authorised Circumstances that are not covered by an appropriate code. Statistical Meaning Authorised Absence Legal Meaning Absent When to use Special occasions at the discretion of the school. This includes a family holiday if it has been agreed in advance. This code should also be used for when a student has completed their school exams but are still in roll to the end of the year. Leave of absence The following codes must be used to record the reason for a pupil being absent with leave: - Leave of absence for the purpose of participating in a regulated performance or undertaking regulated employment abroad – C1 - Leave of absence for a compulsory school age pupil subject to a part-time timetable (return to school plan) – C2. Registration Code D Description Dual registration Meaning Where a pupil is registered at more than one school, this code is used to indicate that the pupil is absent with leave to attend the other school at which they are registered. Example The main examples of dual registration are pupils who are attending a pupil referral unit, a hospital school or a special school on a temporary basis. Registration Code D may only be used by either school for a session where the pupil is scheduled to attend the other school at which they are registered. Registration Code E Description Excluded Statistical Meaning Authorised Absence Example The pupil is suspended from school or permanently excluded from school, but their name is still entered in the admission register, and no alternative provision has been made for the pupil to continue with education. It should not be used if a pupil has been permanently excluded, nor should it be used if a pupil is internally suspended. Then the attendance should be recorded using the normal marks for present. If a permanent exclusion is confirmed, the pupil’s name should be removed from roll and the LA must be informed within 5 school days. If absence has not been agreed in advance and the pupil goes on holiday, absence is unauthorised and should be recorded using Code G. If the authenticity of illness is in doubt will be counted as an unauthorised absence. While schools can request medical evidence to support absence on the grounds of illness, schools are advised not to request medical certificates unnecessarily. Medical evidence can take to form of sight of prescriptions, appointments cards, etc. rather than Doctors’"}

Registration Code Y Y Codes should be used when pupils are unable to attend school because of unavoidable causes. Registration Code Z ISAMS stores details of pupils who are to be admitted in a “pre -dmission group” which is then “rolled forward” at the start of term. However, some pupils do not turn up (because they have started somewhere else) but they are still “on roll” as far as the computer is concerned until they are made a “leaver”. While “on roll” in this way, they will be shown as “unauthorised” absent unless they can be marked as “not yet on roll” in the computer. Non-statutory attendance codes (should not be used for am/pm registration). As a boarding school, we use the following codes to record when a pupil is physically in school but not attending a lessons. We use the following codes so we can track from a safeguarding perspective where pupils are and also look for patterns, for example if a child is back in house on a particular time/day or in the Health centre. - C3- Other Authorised Circumstances (On Site) Drama Lesson - C5 - Other Authorised Circumstances (On Site) Back in House - C6 - Other Authorised Circumstances (On Site) Group Ensemble - C7 - Other Authorised Circumstances (On Site) Music Lesson - C8 - Other Authorised Circumstances (On Site) Personal Music Practice - Other Authorised Circumstances (On Site) Health Centre Appointment – CH As this are non-statutory codes, we must not use these for am/pm reg where we must used the codes as set out in Working together to improve school attendance.

Appendix 3 Pupils/Students Absent Without Authority 1. Introduction The school has written procedures identifying action to be taken when a child is absent without authority. These procedures are known to staff, pupils and their parents or guardians (through the College website). • The procedures cover the following: Searching for any pupil missing or believed to have run away from the College or as a result of a possible abduction to include the timing of reporting pupil missing to: • The Police • To the pupil’s parents or guardians (if appropriate). • Take action to obtain information about the whereabouts of a missing pupil and to try to ensure: • The safety and welfare of that pupil • The collection and return of missing pupil when found • Action to be taken on the pupil’s return. All staff are aware of, and do not exceed, the measures they may properly take to prevent a pupil leaving without permission under current legislation (section 93 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006) and government guidance on the use of force, (see Use of Reasonable Force policy). 2. Unexplained Absence Protocol 2.1 Registration should take place at the start of each lesson. If a pupil is not present and there is no reason for this absence on iSAMS, then the teacher should record this as N – no reason yet provided for this absence and should click the ‘Alert’ button to signify that a pupil is absent. 2.2 This will result in an email being sent to the House Registration Group, College Office, the HsM, and Chris Reid (as Director of Compliance and Operations). The HRG (usually Matrons) are the first port of call for searching and should establish the pupil's whereabouts immediately. This should involve checking with the Health Centre, the music secretary and any trips. When a pupil is found the Matron should amend the register and then email College Office to say that the pupil has been found. College Office should only become active if there is no email received from Matrons by the next lesson. If the pupil's absence cannot be explained the Matron should contact the HsM. If after 30 minutes there is no clear answer as to where the pupil is the DSL team should be contacted and the missing pupil policy brought into action. If an absence occurs outside College Office hours (9am-5pm Mon-Fri and Sat 8-12pm) the Housemaster/Housemistress (HsM) should be contacted directly. 2.3 Unexplained absence from activity / sport.

A record should be kept of pupils who were present, and those who are absent. HsMs should be informed within 45 Minutes of the end of the activity. If it is before 9am or after 5pm then the HsM should be contacted directly. 3 Protocol once a pupil is identified as absent without consent As soon as a pupil is identified as being absent without authority the following action should be to be taken: Inform the HsM who will take responsibility for the investigation. If the HsM is not contactable, the member of staff should inform the DHP who will then identify a suitable member of House staff to assist. The HsM should: • Inform the DSL team as above. The DSL team will inform the Head. • Check all House records and College records (e.g. breakfast signing sheets, registration data) to ascertain the time the pupil was last registered as present. Check authorised trips away from College on Trips Manager. • Phone the pupil on his or her mobile phone. • Phone the Health Centre to check if there is any significant information in their files. • Gather close friends and Prefects together and ask about the missing pupil's whereabouts or any information that may give a clue to his or her whereabouts. Explore the possibility of girlfriend, boyfriend, or siblings and whether this is a useful source of information. • Send an email, with pupil photo to all staff, asking for them to contact the HsM immediately if the pupil is sighted or they have any information. • Check child's room for clues: is the pupil/student’s uniform missing? Has the mobile phone or wallet been taken? • If available check pupil/student’s laptop or mobile phone for possible leads via the ICT Department (only after the specific request is made to do so from the DHP). • Organise a search of the College grounds. • If there is any reason to suspect that the pupil has been abducted, the Crisis Management policy should be consulted. • Arrange for a visit to train and bus stations to check for missing boarder. • Contact parents or guardians (after specific request is made by the DHP). The usual timeframe for this will be one hour from going missing. • Contact the Police (where at all possible, only after contacting parents and after at the specific request of the DHP). The usual timeframe for this will be immediately after parents are informed or attempts have been made to contact them. • Keep Senior and Prep School staff informed if the missing student/pupil has a sibling at the school. • Report back to the DHP when missing pupil/student is located, inform parents, Police etc. • Consult with the DHP about picking up pupil/student as appropriate. • Upon the pupil/student’s return, consider the reasons for the absence, and keep a record of the reasons given by the pupil and any action taken in the light of those reasons (Missing Boarder Form). Depending on the reasons for absence, a period of time at home may be necessary. • Refer immediately to the Designated Safeguarding Leader (DSL) for consideration of possible Child Protection issues. • Make a written record of all incidents of absence without authority using the Missing Pupil/Student Form and forward to the DHP, keeping a copy for the House files. • Notify UKVI of any pupil holding a Tier 4 visa who goes missing and does not return.

Appendix 4 Procedures where a mental health issue is affecting attendance. The following guidance is applied to any pupil displaying social, emotional and mental health issues that is affecting their attendance. It is not only for pupils who have a diagnosed mental health disorder, or a disability or a special educational need. All actions taken to support attendance are referred to as “reasonable adjustments” and this term is used as a way of describing actions in general terms, as opposed to a school’s duty to make reasonable adjustments for pupils with a disability under section 20 of the 2010 Equality Act. Parents/carers have a duty, under section 7 of the Education Act 1996, to ensure that their child of compulsory school age (5 to 16) receives an efficient full-time education either by attendance at school or otherwise, and so share in the responsibility of ensuring good and regular attendance. As such, we encourage parents/carers to be open and work with the school to create a plan for attendance that fits with the needs of the child. Any reasonable adjustments or support put in place should ensure that the time the child spends in school is prioritised as much as is possible. Where support offered is not engaged with, or where all other options have been exhausted or deemed inappropriate, the school will consider whether this meets the threshold for referral to external agencies. While it is the legal responsibility of all parents/carers to ensure their child receives education by full-time attendance at school or otherwise, in some circumstances, where it is in a pupil’s best interests, a plan to help a child to attend may involve the use of a temporary part-time timetable to meet their individual needs. For example, where a medical condition (including a mental health condition) prevents a pupil from attending school full-time and a part-time timetable is considered as part of a re-integration package. Any part-time timetable will seek to maximise face-to-face school time as much as possible. For statistical purposes this is classified as authorised absence and the code C2 should be used. While College will consider providing remote education to help pupils stay on track, this will not be of the same standard as face-to-face class-based learning and should therefore only be a temporary measure, used as part of a plan to reintegrate a pupil back into full time education. If the absence has not been authorised, there can be no expectation of remote learning. The Assistant Head (Safeguarding & Pupil Welfare) oversees issues with attendance, which is linked to a mental health concern. In order to help support, the following procedures will be followed: • Where attendance has been identified by the tutor, HsM as falling below 90% for an extended period of time (half termly), an attendance support plan should be initiated by the Tutor/HsM. If absences occur mainly at home (specifically day, day boarders, Tutors/HsMs should contact parents/guardians to make a plan to improve attendance. • If absence persists, a referral should be made to the DSL through CPOMs (tutors should upload the attendance support plan). • The AH (S & PW) will gather the facts to start a PPP. This may include conducting a risk assessment to consider any potential safeguarding/welfare issues. • In doing so, the AH (S & PW) and the Attendance Lead will work with parents/carers as well as with the pupil to understand the barriers to regular attendance and, where appropriate, make reasonable adjustments to overcome those specific barriers. This will be documented in the absence support plan. This could include the introduction of temporary part time timetables. Any reduced timetables will be for the shortest amount of time possible, whilst arrangements are made to support the pupil’s return to full-time provision as soon as possible. • Parents are expected to proactively engage with the formal support offered –"}

This policy provides guidance for all pupils, staff and parents about recognising bullying and what to do if a bullying incident occurs. This policy has been drawn up with assistance from the guidance issued by the DfE Preventing and Tackling Bullying (July 2017) and will be reviewed against subsequent government guidance issued from time to time. A copy of this policy is available on The Prep’s website and upon request from the Bursar’s PA and should be read in conjunction with The Prep’s: • Child Protection and Safeguarding Policy • Child on Child Abuse Policy • E-Safety and ICT Acceptable Use Policy • Behaviour Policy • Keeping Children Safe in Education Pupils, staff and parents should also see the supplementary advice documents and other helpful resources listed throughout this policy. Aim: The ultimate aim of The Prep’s anti-bullying policy is to prevent bullying of any sort and to ensure that everyone can operate in a supportive, caring and safe environment without the fear of being bullied. All members of the community, including Council, teaching and non-teaching staff, pupils and parents should have an understanding of what bullying is and be familiar with the policy on bullying. Bullying is an anti-social behaviour, which affects everyone; it is unacceptable and it will not be tolerated. Everyone in the community has a responsibility to report any incident of bullying that comes to their attention and these reports will always be taken seriously. Only when all issues of bullying are addressed will our pupils be able to fully benefit from the opportunities available at The Prep. Definition: Bullying may be defined as any behaviour that intentionally hurts another pupil or group physically or emotionally. It is often motivated by prejudice against particular groups, for example, on grounds of race, religion, culture, sex, gender, homophobia, special educational needs and disability, or because a child is adopted or is a carer – it may occur directly or through cyber-technology (social websites, mobile phones, text messages, photographs and email). Everyone in the community has a responsibility to report any incident of bullying that comes to their attention and these reports will always be taken seriously. Only when all issues of bullying are addressed will our pupils be able to fully benefit from the opportunities available at The Prep. Examples of unacceptable behaviour include: • Physical (including sexual) assault. For example, hitting, kicking, spitting, removing belongings, damaging property. • Verbal abuse, by name calling, teasing, insulting, writing notes or making offensive remarks. • Cyber-bullying, which is defined as the use of technology by an individual or group to support deliberate, repeated and hostile behaviour intended to harm others. Examples include using social media (such as Snapchat or Instagram), mobile phones, text messaging, photographs, video, e-mail and sexting. • Emotional bullying can also involve the manipulation of social networks. It may involve the spreading of rumours or malicious accusations with the repeated intention of insulting, excluding or marginalising individuals from their friends and normal relationships. Protected Characteristics Bullying may involve complicity that falls short of direct participation by, for instance, manipulating a third party to tease or torment someone. It may be overt and intimidatory but is often hidden and subtle. It includes actions or comments that fall under the protected characteristics (although bullying is not limited to these), pertaining to a pupil’s: • age • sex • race • disability • religion or belief • sexual orientation • gender reassignment Prejudice based bullying Prejudice based bullying is repeated hurtful behaviour that exploits or abuses someone based on their actual or supposed membership of a vulnerable group or their support for such a group. The protected characteristics identified in the Equality Act 2010 (as set out above) are particularly relevant in this context. Staff should therefore be vigilant around bullying that could be : • related to race, religion, belief or culture • homophobic, biphobic,"}

The protected characteristics identified in the Equality Act 2010 (as set out above) are particularly relevant in this context. Staff should therefore be vigilant around bullying that could be : • related to race, religion, belief or culture • homophobic, biphobic, transphobic • sexist, sexual or which focusses on disabilities or other physical attributes. • related to special educational needs (SEND), learning difficulties or disabilities or health conditions • related to personal appearance or body shape; • young carers or looked after children or adopted children or otherwise related to home circumstances. SEND pupils Children with special educational needs or disabilities (SEND) or certain medical or physical health conditions can face additional challenges when dealing with instances of bullying. Additional barriers can exist when recognising impacts of bullying for this group of children. These can include: • assumptions that indicators of possible abuse such as behaviour, mood and injury relate to the child’s condition without further exploration • these children being more prone to peer group isolation or bullying (including prejudice-based bullying) than other children • the potential for children with SEND or certain medical conditions being disproportionately impacted by behaviours such as bullying, without outwardly showing any signs, and • communication barriers and difficulties in managing or reporting these challenges. • cognitive understanding – being unable to understand the difference between fact and fiction in online content and then repeating the content/behaviours in schools or colleges or the consequences of doing so. Any reports of bullying involving children with SEND will therefore require close liaison with the Designated Safeguarding Lead and the SENCO. The seriousness of bullying cannot be over-emphasised. Bullying is among the top concerns that parents have about their children’s safety and well-being at, and on the way to and from, school. Bullying is also a top concern of children and young people themselves. Bullying makes the lives of its victims a misery: it undermines their confidence and self-esteem, and destroys their sense of security. Bullying impacts on its victims’ attendance and attainment at school; marginalises those individuals or groups who may be particular targets for bullies, and can have a life-long negative impact on some young people’s lives. At worst, bullying can be a factor in pupil suicide. It is acknowledged that bullies may have complex reasons for their behaviour and may well also need help. It should also be recognised that the consequences of being allowed to ‘get away with it’ can be detrimental to them as well as to their victim. All pupils deserve the opportunity to be helped to understand what acceptable behaviour is. There are criminal laws that apply to harassment, assault, distribution of inappropriate images and threatening behaviour. What to look for: Pupils who are being bullied may show changes in behaviour, such as becoming shy and nervous, feigning illness, taking unusual absences or clinging to adults. There may be evidence of changes in work patterns, lacking concentration or truanting from school. All members of the community must be alert to the signs of bullying and act promptly and firmly against it, in accordance with policy. Surveys have shown that in the vast majority of bullying incidents, MOST people knew that what was going on was wrong. Sometimes people, either through lethargy, peer group pressure, or tacit support for what is going on, fail to take action. What to do: The way to eliminate bullying is for people to be aware of the issues involved, and to be clear in their own minds what action to take should concerns arise: If you are the victim: If you feel able to, make it clear to the person that has upset you that you do not like what he or she is doing and ask them to stop. Do not respond physically. Bullies want to upset you; if you respond calmly, they will see"}

Do not respond physically. Bullies want to upset you; if you respond calmly, they will see little point in trying again. Share your feelings with someone else. Ideally, talk to any member of staff or any other trusted adult with whom you feel comfortable. Posters are displayed around the school with details of the people who can help you as well as listing websites and phone numbers that may be of use. If you would rather not go straight to a member of staff, talk to your friends but don’t keep the problem to yourself. They may well be able to advise on an appropriate course of action or will be able to involve other people who can. Tell your parents or another family member. Remember that you can always use the “Just wanted you to know” pupil voice boxes around the school or use the email address safe@cheltenhamcollege.org There are also people outside The Prep who would be willing to help: Childline: www.childline.org.uk 0800 1111 Kidscape: www.kidscape.org.uk The Children’s Commissioner: 0800 528 0731 Safeguarding Children in Gloucestershire: 01452 426565 Patrick Wheaton Independent Listener: 07557 105634 The Pupil Planners also contain useful guidance on what to do if you feel you are being bullied. If you, a pupil, witness bullying behaviour: Act! Support the victim by offering your friendship and make it clear that in your opinion what is happening to them is wrong. Encourage them to speak out, or speak out on their behalf and tell a member of staff who can help. Take the victim to a trusted adult as described above and reassure them that doing something will make a positive difference, or suggest that you see someone on their behalf. If you, a member of Staff, witness an incident of bullying or it is reported to you: Reassure and support the pupils involved. Advise them that you are required to pass details on to the relevant members of the pastoral team. This could be either their Form teacher, Section or the Head of Wellbeing depending on the gravity of the incident. Inform the appropriate member of the pastoral team as soon as possible. All bullying-related incidents should be written up as an ‘incident’ on CPOMS (Child Protection Online Management System) and passed on to the Senior Deputy Head, who will keep a central log of all complaints or incidences of confirmed bullying and record the way in which they were dealt with on CPOMS. What will happen: The victim will be interviewed by the appropriate member of the pastoral team and might be asked to write an immediate account of events where relevant and depending on the age and nature of the issue. The process for dealing with bullying will be explained clearly to them. The victim is also given the opportunity to discuss his /her own reactions and behaviour towards the bully. The victim is given support and advice and counselling is suggested if deemed appropriate. Bullying Levels and Actions Level 0 (Stage 0) Thoughtlessness: If a pupil has made comments that are unkind and hurtful, but are considered to be clearly thoughtless the form taker or Head of Section may have a conversation with the pupil about the impact of their behaviour.

Level 1 (Stage 1) Where there is a degree of repetition, or where thoughtless behaviour involves physicality, or if there is an imbalance of power such as where the victim is a vulnerable pupil, or where the bullying is across different year groups. At Level 1 it is likely to involve a meeting with the Head of Section and parents may be informed, depending upon circumstances. This stage may be by-passed and sanctions imposed immediately if bullying is found to be more serious. Level 2 (Stage 2) Warning as to future conduct: If, after the above discussion, the bullying continues, it will be assumed that it is deliberate and a more severe approach will need to be taken. If an individual incident of bullying is deemed serious enough, this may also warrant a `level 2 intervention. Sanctions will depend on the severity of the bullying. Following a discussion between the Head of Section and the Senior Deputy Head a formal letter will be sent to parents. A meeting with parents and Senior Deputy Head may be necessary. Level 3 (Stage 3) If after these two steps the bullying continues, it will be assumed that the pupil has no respect for those around him / her and this will not be tolerated within the school community. In this situation a meeting between parents and the Head to discuss a pupil’s position in the Prep community will be arranged. In very serious cases it may be necessary to make a report to the Police or Social Services. The school reserves the right to act to address a pupil's conduct when s/he is not on school premises or under control of a Prep member of staff. This may include contacting outside agencies. The above levels are equally applicable for breaches of acceptable behaviour online Reparation: This may be used in conjunction with any Level of Bullying. It offers a ‘no-blame’ approach to both parties. The victim(s) and their bully(ies) may have a discussion with a teacher who would normally be the Deputy Head Pastoral. This discussion allows both parties to give their opinions and to try to work out a solution which is mutually agreeable. The aim is to allow the bullies to realise that they are causing unhappiness and that their behaviour will not be tolerated. Everything in this discussion will be recorded in writing and filed. Following this, communication will be made with parents / guardians to let them know about the situation and what has been done. This will be confidential, although tutors should be made aware and an Incident should be uploaded to CPOMS. In all cases it is important that the “voice of the child” is heard and that their views are sought and recorded. A pupil may choose not to partake in the reparation process, for example. Prevention: The Prep will raise the awareness of all the staff through staff briefings and take action to reduce the risk of bullying at the times and places where it is most likely to occur. The pupils’ version of this policy will be prominently displayed on school notice boards and will be discussed with pupils during Form teacher sessions. It will also be revisited as necessary during Thrive sessions to all years and reinforced in other areas of the curriculum as the opportunities present themselves. Anti-bullying will feature as a discussion point for the School Council. Anti-bullying week (November) is used to raise awareness and educate pupils. Prep School Pupil Planners also contain an Anti-Bullying statement which clarifies procedures. The record of bullying offences is reviewed regularly by the Senior Deputy Head and the Deputy Head (Pastoral) in order to identify patterns and check that the policy is effective and introduce additional initiatives when necessary.

Anti-Bullying is also a standing item on the whole school Pastoral Management Group’s (PMG) termly agenda. One of the most effective ways to prevent bullying is to celebrate the successes of individuals in a variety of different fields. Prevention of Cyber-bullying: In addition to the preventative measures described above, The Prep: • Expects all pupils to adhere to its E-Safety and ICT Acceptable Use Policy • Certain sites are blocked by our filtering system (Smoothwall) and the Information Services Department monitors pupils’ use • May impose sanctions for the misuse or attempted misuse of the internet or e mail • E-safety talks are delivered on a regular basis and other suitable speakers, on a rolling programme, offering guidance on the safe use of social networking sites, including keeping personal details safe • Cyber-bullying is covered in Thrive sessions • Pupils are not permitted to use mobile phones in school. Day pupils using the bus to get to school or return home are allowed to have a mobile phone but this is dropped and collected from Reception every day. Full boarders have a designated iPad in Cade House in order to communicate with their parents at dedicated times through FaceTime or Teams. • The use of cameras (including those on mobile phones) is not allowed in washing and changing areas or in the bedrooms of the Boarding House. • Has an assigned member of the Senior Leadership Team responsible for Digital Technology (Deputy Head Academic) The issue of Cyber-bullying is one that The Prep takes seriously, not least because when our pupils leave school they need to realise that based on the Malicious Communications Act 1988 it is an offence for a person to send an electronic communication to another person with the intent to cause distress or anxiety or to send an electronic communication which conveys a message which is indecent or grossly offensive, a threat, or information which is false and known to be believed to be false by the sender.

Introduction Support for learning is fully incorporated within teaching and learning practices and the Learning Support department works in partnership with academic departments and the pastoral teams to ensure a holistic and inclusive educational experience for all pupils. A Quality First Teaching approach is used, whereby teachers deliver high quality, inclusive lessons that are responsive to the diverse needs of learners. Teaching and learning activities are differentiated and adapted where necessary to support individual progress and attainment. Where needed, the Learning Support department provides targeted, evidence-informed support to help pupils to enjoy learning, achieve their academic potential and to develop increasing independence. As a co-educational, academically selective school offering a traditional academic curriculum, learning in its broadest sense is central to the school’s ethos. This policy describes the philosophy and practices underpinning the educational support throughout the school and the pathways followed to support pupils in their educational journey. It reflects the school’s commitment to providing high quality care and educational experience, informed by national frameworks: • The Children and Families Act 2014 • Every Child Matters • Equality Act 2010 • Teachers’ Standards 2012 • SEND Code of Practice 2015 (updated 2020) • Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) • Keeping Children Safe in Education (2024) This policy should be read in conjunction with the following school policies: • Child Protection and Safeguarding Policy • Admissions Policy • Disability Policy • Equality and Diversity Policy • Reasonable Adjustments Policy • Examinations Access Arrangements Policy • Anti-bullying Policy EAL Policy • More Able and Talented Policy This should also be considered in conjunction with the Three Year Access plan for the respective school, which detail steps taken by the school to broaden access. The school believes that pupils with specific learning difficulties, sensory impairments or disabilities should be enabled to participate as fully as possible in school life, with reasonable adjustments made to facilitate inclusion wherever possible. Pupils should have full access to the curriculum provided and must not face discrimination. Children with Special Educational Needs (SEN) may be at increased risk to abuse; staff must remain vigilant and ensure safeguarding practices reflect an understanding of the additional vulnerabilities these pupils may face. Perpetrators may themselves have experienced abuse and may repeat harmful behaviours; this possibility should inform staff awareness and responses. Some pupils with specific needs may be prone to isolation and may require tailored pastoral support and structured interventions to promote social inclusion and emotional wellbeing. 3 b. Admission Arrangements As an academically selective school, the admission of pupils who have a mild learning difficulty, sensory impairment or disability is considered where the required academic level is met through the entrance process and the school is confident that a pupil can be successful and happy in the environment. The school aims to"}

Some pupils with specific needs may be prone to isolation and may require tailored pastoral support and structured interventions to promote social inclusion and emotional wellbeing. 3 b. Admission Arrangements As an academically selective school, the admission of pupils who have a mild learning difficulty, sensory impairment or disability is considered where the required academic level is met through the entrance process and the school is confident that a pupil can be successful and happy in the environment. The school aims to be inclusive in its admissions practices and to support pupils ion achieving their full potential. However, it is essential that the school can provide an environment in which a pupil can thrive both academically and personally within the scope of the support reasonably available. As part of the admissions process, the Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCo) may review any disclosed needs, relevant documentation, and professional reports to determine whether the school can meet the pupil’s needs effectively. It is important that, with appropriate support and reasonable adjustments, the pupil can independently participate in and benefit from with the mainstream curriculum as delivered by subject teachers and in the wider life of the school. Most pupils with a mild difficulty, sensory impairment or disability can be supported through the educational provision generally available at the school. The SENCo’s assessment is made with the intention of ensuring the school is the right fit for the pupil's learning profile, and that the pupil is likely to experience success, inclusion, and well-being rather than simply managing or \"surviving\" in a potentially unsuitable environment. Where additional support is likely to be necessary this is discussed with parents prior to the offer being made to ensure that expectations are aligned and appropriate provisions can be put in place. Appendices 11 and 12 illustrate the process for reviewing relevant documents received by Admissions. c. Academic life The school provides a rich academic experience to help pupils thrive, utilizing adaptive teaching methods that cater to diverse learning styles and needs. Education is further enhanced by an extensive co-curricular, enrichment and wellbeing programme. Strong pastoral support helps pupils to flourish academically as well as in aspects of life. Tutors monitor academic attainment and assist pupils in setting targets and making informed decisions. For boarders, House routines and staff support educational success by encouraging quality homework and revision. The school has high expectations for all pupils, including particular groups of pupils: i. Definitions and Provision for Pupils with Diverse Learning Needs Pupils with Learning Difficulties and Special Educational Needs (SEN) A child or young person has a learning difficulty if they experience significantly greater difficulty in learning than the majority of others of the same age. Learning difficulties span a wide spectrum of needs, typically grouped into four broad areas (DfE & DoH, 2015): • Cognition and learning • Communication and interaction • Social, emotional and mental health (SEMH) • Sensory and/or physical needs At this academically selective school (entry from Year 3), the most common difficulties include: 4 • Mild dyslexia • Mild developmental coordination disorder (dyspraxia) • Mild attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) • Processing speed difficulties The school is committed to inclusive, high-quality teaching that removes barriers to learning and supports pupils with mild learning difficulties, sensory impairments, or disabilities. Where needed, additional intervention may be offered through the Learning Support department. This may include individual or small group sessions focused on specific skills such as literacy, organisation or study strategies. These sessions incur a fee, detailed in Appendix 3. Most pupils with mild learning difficulties can be supported through adaptive classroom teaching without the need for regular additional lessons. They are monitored carefully and teachers flag any concerns with the SENCo. A child is considered to have Special Educational Needs (SEN) if their learning difficulty or disability requires special educational provision beyond that generally available (Children and Families Act 2014, s.20). In cases of more complex needs, an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP) may be in place, or developed in consultation with the local authority. See Section 4 for further details. 2. Pupils with a"}

In cases of more complex needs, an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP) may be in place, or developed in consultation with the local authority. See Section 4 for further details. 2. Pupils with a Disability Under the Equality Act 2010, a disability is defined as a “physical or mental impairment” that has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on a person’s ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities (Equality Act 2010, s.6). The school is legally required to make reasonable adjustments to ensure pupils with disabilities. 3. Pupils for Whom English is an Additional Language (EAL) The school values the cultural and linguistic diversity brought by its international pupils. EAL learners sit an entrance assessment to determine English language proficiency. Additional support may be provided to develop literacy and fluency in English, including preparation for the IELTS examination at Sixth Form level. The EAL department supports both academic and cultural adjustment and monitors language development. Where there is concern about learning progress, teachers will assess whether difficulties stem from language acquisition or may indicate an underlying learning need. Further guidance is provided in the school’s EAL Policy. 4. More Able and Talented Pupils The needs of high-attaining pupils are met through differentiated extension work in lessons, enrichment activities, academic societies, and competitions. Those on academic scholarships or identified as more able and/or talented are supported to stretch their capabilities both within and beyond the curriculum. More information is available in the school’s More Able and Talented Policy. Section 2: Support offered a. ‘Quality first’ teaching Teachers are responsible for recognising and addressing the individual learning needs of their pupils. Following the Teachers’ Standards (DfE, 2012) and SEND Code of Practice (DfE & DoH, 2015), they must plan and deliver high-quality, differentiated lessons that respond to each 5 pupil’s learning profile, including those with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). Effective teaching includes: • A broad, balanced, and well-sequenced curriculum • Regular formative assessment • Explicit development of literacy, oracy, and subject-specific language • Use of evidence-based strategies to support study skills and metacognition When setting classes by ability, teachers ensure pupils with learning differences or disabilities are fairly included. The Learning Support Department assists by providing personalised learning profiles, advising on classroom strategies, collaborating on inclusive practices, and delivering targeted interventions. All staff are expected to implement recommended adjustments and promote an inclusive environment where every pupil can thrive. i. Teacher training The school is committed to ensuring that all teaching staff are confident, knowledgeable, and effective in meeting the needs of pupils with learning differences. Teachers receive regular in-service training (INSET) and have opportunities to attend externally run courses in order to enhance their practice. INSET ensures that teachers are well-informed about their responsibilities and equipped to help pupils with learning differences. Teachers who are new to the school and on placement are informed about support through the Induction Programme, which includes an introduction to the Learning Support Department, key policies and referral procedures. Further information about teaching pupils with learning differences is available to teachers via the school’s digital learning platform and through reference materials available in the staff resource area at the Prep School. Resources are curated to ensure relevance and currency. ii. The Individual Learning Needs list (ILN list) Teachers are informed of pupils’ individual learning needs via the Individual Learning Needs (ILN) list and the school’s secure pupil database. These tools identify pupils with SEN, disabilities, or medical conditions that affect learning, and outline recommended classroom strategies and adjustments. Both the ILN list and database are regularly updated, and staff are notified of changes to ensure teaching is responsive and inclusive. Pupil records clearly indicate whether a pupil is learning independently or is receiving additional support, such as Learning Support sessions or exam access arrangements, in line with SEND"}

Pupil records clearly indicate whether a pupil is learning independently or is receiving additional support, such as Learning Support sessions or exam access arrangements, in line with SEND Code of Practice (DfE & DoH, 2015) and JCQ guidance (2024). iii. Exiting the ILN list A pupil’s name may be removed from the list if: • a pupil entered for monitoring purposes makes progress • assessment shows that no further action is required • the pupil has made progress and no longer requires extra support • a special examination arrangement, such as typing, is no longer required • there is no SEN that continues to influence learning 6 b. Targeted interventions If a pupil does not make expected progress despite high-quality, differentiated teaching, the class teacher consults with the tutor and/or SENCo to consider whether the pupil may have an underlying learning difficulty or would benefit from additional support. Any ongoing support is arranged in consultation with parents and is tailored to individual need. The class teacher remains responsible for the pupil’s progress in the classroom, in accordance with the graduated approach outlined in the SEND Code of Practice (2015). Pupils are encouraged to take an active role in their learning, including seeking help when needed, as part of developing independence and self-advocacy skills. Support strategies are regularly reviewed to evaluate their impact and adjusted as appropriate. This ensures that intervention remains effective, targeted, and proportionate. In the context of assessments, the SENCO should have oversight of any interventions deemed necessary or unnecessary, based on a holistic understanding of the pupil’s learning profile. This includes, for example, the decision to allocate or withhold retakes for internal assessments, particularly for pupils with identified learning needs (ILNs). This is in conjunction with the wider academic team. A wide range of flexible intervention programmes are available across the school to meet individual needs. Examples are detailed in Appendices 4 and 5, which outline provision at the Prep and College respectively – which are different. Further school support Pupils are encouraged to attend revision clinics arranged by academic departments. Tutors, teachers and Heads of Sections liaise about Academic Support Plans or Satis Cards (College) or Focus Reports (the Prep), which target specific improvements, such as concentration, punctuality or organisation and provide timely lesson-by-lesson feedback. Academic Support Plans are also used in structuring support for a pupil preparing for examinations. Additionally, College offers Supervised Study and Classroom Support, providing individualized assistance with teachers outside of regular lessons). Resources Many electronic resources to aid learning and revision are available to pupils. At the Prep, eligible pupils may be permitted to use a laptop in certain lessons due to their specific learning needs. They are encouraged to develop touch typing skills. Some pupils also use assistive devices such as reading pens. At College, pupils routinely use laptops or tablets for prep and coursework and classroom tasks where necessary. However, the ability to present neatly handwritten work remains essential, and pupils are encouraged to maintain and develop their handwriting and typing skills. College offers touch typing courses and support with the use of assistive technology for those who require it. Study skills are embedded in teaching and learning. At College, revision clinics are arranged in the lead-up to public examinations and study skills seminars arranged at strategic times. Information on revision and a range of study skills is available to teachers and pupils through the College library. College pupils are encouraged to use the Ben White Learning Centre, the Chatfeild Roberts 7 Library and subject libraries as suitable working areas during study periods and at other times. At the Prep there is a programme of Study Skills in Middle and Upper School; with pupils being given advice on how to revise, types of resources to make and"}

At the Prep there is a programme of Study Skills in Middle and Upper School; with pupils being given advice on how to revise, types of resources to make and also provided with support for planning their revision. Pupils who come to Coach House in Upper School often have Study Skills incorporated into their teaching programmes. The Learning Support Department Entry Pupils’ academic progress is closely monitored throughout their time at the school via regular assessments and detailed teacher feedback, enabling timely identification of learning needs. The Learning Support department offers additional assistance in literacy, study skills, and organisation for individuals or small groups. Maths support is provided at the Prep through the Learning Support department, while College pupils can access subject-led Maths clinics. A pupil’s SEN needs are reviewed upon entry through collaboration with parents, the previous school, and examination of assessment, medical, and school reports. Where transitional support is beneficial, this is discussed with parents and arranged accordingly. At College, pupils with prior learning support experience are encouraged to develop independence within new routines, with appropriate guidance from tutors, House staff, and teachers. Strong communication and collaboration between Learning Support, teaching, and pastoral teams ensure that additional help is provided as needed, taking into account available resources and the individual pupil’s circumstances. Contact with parents and pupils Parents of prospective pupils with individual learning needs may visit the Learning Support department when they initially tour the school and meet with department staff. Parents are asked to send copies of relevant documentation to Admissions prior to entry, so support arrangements can be considered and made in advance where desirable. At the Prep, some initial assessments for literacy and numeracy may be offered to assess the level of Learning Support or EAL required in order to advise whether the level of support required can be provided. The Prep and College liaise closely at transfer. Parents are invited to remain in contact with the respective Learning Support departments and to make contact at any time if they have concerns or queries. Learning Support teachers attend Parents' Meetings at College. Throughout their time in College, pupils are encouraged to discuss academic matters with their tutors and they are also welcome to contact Learning Support staff if they feel that they need extra support. Learning Support staff Both schools’ Learning Support Departments are staffed by a SENCo and two Learning Support teachers, all of whom hold suitable specialist qualifications. At College, a Learning Mentor is available during the afternoon and evening to help pupils with skills such as essay planning, organisation, homework and study skills. Some general in class support is provided by Learning Support Workers in Year 3 and 4, and attached to the English and Maths Departments at The Prep. 8 Extra lessons in the Learning Support department Where a pupil may benefit from regular weekly extra lessons with a specialist teacher, parents are contacted. At the Prep, if parents accept the offer of regular support, pupils are withdrawn from certain non–academic subjects for the support lessons. At College, lessons are usually arranged at a suitable time to avoid curriculum lessons being missed. Support arrangements are reviewed on a termly basis and lessons discontinued when they are no longer needed. Parents are encouraged to contribute to decisions regarding the conclusion of these lessons. Identification of SEN The Learning Support department plays a key role in identifying pupils who may have areas of learning difficulty. Screening is conducted as required at the Prep and at College in Year 9, Year 12, and for entrants to Year 10. If screening results fall below the average range, further assessment may be undertaken by a specialist teacher or by an Educational Psychologist (EP) who has an established relationship with the school. Such assessments provide detailed"}

If screening results fall below the average range, further assessment may be undertaken by a specialist teacher or by an Educational Psychologist (EP) who has an established relationship with the school. Such assessments provide detailed insights to inform appropriate support strategies. When an EP assessment is arranged, parents or guardians liaise directly with the assessor regarding any associated fees. Assessments may also be necessary where an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP) exists or is being applied for. Relevant feedback from assessments, including recommended interventions, is shared with parents, pupils, teachers, tutors, and House staff. By providing assessment information, parents consent to the necessary disclosure of details to staff involved in supporting the pupil’s learning and progress. Teachers contribute to early identification by raising concerns with the pupil’s tutor and the Learning Support team when learning difficulties are suspected. Where issues related to vision, hearing, or other physical, behavioural, or cognitive factors are suspected to impact learning, specialist assessment may be recommended. Flowcharts outlining the processes for learning support provision and identification of specific learning difficulties are available in Appendices 9 and 10. Making special examination access arrangements If a pupil has SEN status or a disability that significantly affects their working pace, their eligibility for special exam access arrangements is considered following JCQ regulations. Eligibility is based on evidence from assessments, usually starting in Year 9 and reviewed in Year 12. The College SENCo works with the Examinations Manager and staff to implement approved arrangements reasonably within the school’s capacity. Documentation proving the ongoing impact of the disability on learning and exams is carefully maintained to meet JCQ standards. Previous arrangements don’t automatically continue; current evidence and teacher observations reflecting the pupil’s usual classroom support are required. The SENCo consults teachers to assess ongoing needs and reasonable adjustments, and parents are invited to discuss arrangements to ensure transparency. 9 The school stays up to date with JCQ eligibility criteria through annual training and ensures compliance with current guidelines. The Prep: tests and examinations Class tests normally occur within normal lesson times without exam access arrangements. Eligible pupils have access arrangements in place for the Summer Term exams, where applicable, for Years 5-7 and for the Common Entrance exams in Year 8. Any pupils sitting the ISEB 11+ Pre-Test may, with negotiation with the senior school of choice, have additional time awarded in line with exam access arrangements. College: Tests and Examinations - Third Form In conjunction with the results of assessments done in the Learning Support department, the class tests taken in November help to determine whether previously established examination arrangements such as extra time are still needed. Class tests usually occur within normal lesson times and are written in normal time. Test feedback recognises pupils with SEN who have previously had special examination arrangements. In the summer examinations, a Third Form pupil may be eligible for special examination arrangements if: • there is current documented evidence of a specific learning difficulty or disability and • teachers’ observations of performance in lessons and class tests confirm the need for special examination arrangements. Fourth Form, Fifth Form and Upper College Wherever possible, eligible pupils in the Fourth, Fifth Form and Upper College have special examination arrangements in class tests. Eligible pupils have special examination access arrangements in College examinations. Transfer of information Arrangements are in place to ensure for the smooth transfer of documents and information to the next phase of education. SENCos liaise with their counterparts at receiving schools and transfer relevant document to future schools, with parental permission. If a Sixth Form student wishes to forward their personal documentation to a university, they must request in writing that a copy be sent to their own address, for forwarding as they choose.

If a Sixth Form student wishes to forward their personal documentation to a university, they must request in writing that a copy be sent to their own address, for forwarding as they choose. Curriculum changes Every learner should have access to a full complement of academic subjects, but consideration may be given to a reduction in the number of subjects taken, particularly where a pupil has medical or health care needs. Any reduction must be approved by the Deputy Head Academic (DHA). In exceptional circumstances, some curriculum and related assessment arrangements can be modified or disapplied. Changes are only agreed after consultation with parents that includes agreement about alternative provision. Section 3: Early Years and Foundation Stage Provision There is an emphasis on quality teaching and the class teacher, not only the Pre-Prep/EYFS SENCo, is responsible for supporting all pupils. The 2 year check should give an informative start point. Behaviour is not a learning difficulty issue, the 3 prime areas are: • Physical development • Communication and language 10 • Personal, social and emotional development These are strengthened and applied in the areas of the early years goals. The expectation is that Early Years practitioners will have a basic knowledge of SEN and be able to plan activities to help the child to overcome gaps or delays in learning. Where the gap does not close, the question needs to be asked about possible learning difficulties and further investigation undertaken. The process of graduated response is Assess, Plan, Do, Review. Phase one: The EYFS profiles are used to inform parents that a child is not making expected rates of development. The teacher plans high quality activities to target areas of weakness. Regular assessment identifies if a child is still not making expected rates of progress. The teacher and SENCo gather evidence and assess informally, involving parents where possible. A Pre-Prep/EYFS Record of Concern may be raised to allow further investigation and assessment. Extra activities and/or interventions are put in place. The impact of intervention is reviewed and the programme repeated or support moves to an Early Years Support Plan.

The Local Authority manages EHCPs for ages 0-25 and publishes a Local Offer outlining available support. Gloucestershire’s Local Offer can be found at: https://www.glosfamiliesdirectory.org.uk/kb5/gloucs/glosfamilies/family.page?familychannel=2 Education Health Care Plan (EHCP) or EHCP request If a child doesn’t make expected progress despite support, additional measures may be needed. Without an existing EHCP, the school may consult parents and refer the child to external specialists or request a statutory EHCP assessment from the Local Authority (LA). The school provides the LA with records of support already given. An EHCP can include LA-funded services like speech therapy or a carer, and its objectives are reviewed annually. The SENCo regularly communicates with any personal assistants or support workers. In Prep, Pupil Passports are created with the pupil for those with an EHCP or high needs, outlining classroom support, challenges, exam arrangements, and curriculum access. Additional services required by the EHCP may incur charges billed to parents or the LA, depending on responsibility, in line with the Equality Act 2010. Section 5: Roles and Responsibilities Responsibilities of teachers Teachers are responsible for the progress and development of the pupils in their class and for maintaining high academic expectations. Through Quality First teaching, they are expected to use varied and suitable teaching and learning approaches to support pupils with SEN and disabilities, to help to identify pupils with SEN and help determine suitable examination access arrangements. In delivering excellent targeted Quality First teaching, teachers: • maintain the highest possible expectations, setting suitable challenges • build on what the pupil knows, understands and can do • adapt teaching to ensure that the pupil is fully involved in learning • use specific strategies suggested by the SENCo to support the pupil’s learning, liaising with the SENCo as needed • check gaps in understanding and providing extra support Responsibilities of Heads of Department (HoDs) and Heads of Section HoDs ensure that schemes of work enable the curriculum to be covered fully and within appropriate time-scales, so that sufficient time is available for consolidation and revision. At 12 the start of the year, HoDs ensure that members of their department have accessed the ISAMs records of pupils with individual learning needs and have made a note of class support strategies. They also ensure that regular opportunities are provided for discussion about pupils causing concern, track academic progress and ensure that regular clinics are available. The SENCos are members of the HoD teams. Heads of Section monitor progress across subjects and may also help tutors to implement additional support strategies for individuals, such as a Pastoral Support Plan or Academic Support Plan. Responsibilities of the SENCos: • Managing staff, teaching and resources in the Learning Support department • Attending HoDs meetings and liaising with the Deputy Head Academic, SLT and the SEN Governor • Maintaining the ILN list, creating Individual Learning Plans, circulating support information and liaising with colleagues about class support • Contributing to the study skills programme • Meeting with and reporting progress to parents or guardians • Identifying pupils who may have a learning difficulties or those who may benefit from additional support, and arranging for EP or other specialist assessments as needed • Monitoring academic progress of pupils with learning difficulties • Evaluating provision of support across the school and arranging relevant INSET • Assessing pupils to determine eligibility for"}

At the Prep, the the SENCo is on SLT and the Deputy Head Pastoral is responsible for matters relating to wellbeing. At College the Deputy Head Learning and Wellbeing presents Learning Support matters at SLT. Section 6: Management and review Evaluating the effectiveness of learning support The effectiveness of teaching and learning is evaluated through structures such as the HoDs meetings, work scrutinies, lesson observations and teachers’ professional development reviews. HoDs, Heads of Section and tutors track academic progress and SENCos monitor the progress of pupils on the ILN list. The SENCos may observe lessons with a specific focus on the teaching strategies and adjustments made to support the needs of different groups of learners. Follow-up discussions focus upon specific in-class interventions that could be beneficial. Pupil, parent and teacher feedback and reports help to identify targeted skills for Learning Support lessons or discontinuation of these lessons. Tracking pupil progress 13 An overview of progress is maintained by the Deputy Heads Academic and Heads of Section. Regular meetings are held between relevant parties to discuss specific concerns with a pupil’s progress. Parent Meetings also provide an opportunity for staff to discuss a child’s progress with their parents. Learning Support staff contact and meet parents as required. Links with other professionals The school works on a regular basis with independent EPs, Speech and Language Therapists and Occupational Therapists. Inter-agency co-operation is in place to ensure provision meets the needs of the children with disabilities. Links are made with external agencies as appropriate, including the LA, other schools and Health and Social Services. Members of the department engage in continuing professional development activities and attend meetings where matters of professional interest and national directives are discussed and good practice is shared. The schools hold membership of PATOSS, the Professional Association of Teachers of Students with Specific Learning Difficulties. The College SENCo attends the Rugby Group SENCo meeting; the Prep has good links with the National Handwriting Association and is a member of NASEN, the National Association for Special Educational needs. Storing and managing information Information on the Learning Hub Tracker and the database is reviewed termly and updated where necessary. Standardised scores for literacy skills tests are available to teachers. The SENCos ensure that all appropriate records are kept and available when needed. Parental consent is sought for copies made of confidential documents such as EP reports, which are stored securely in the Learning Support department and are usually disposed of once the individual reaches 25 years of age. Health Records are maintained by the Health Centre in consultation with parents. Class teachers record ongoing achievements and observations and maintain individual records and portfolios. The SENCos maintain records and archive them appropriately in liaison with Archives staff. Reviewing the policy The Learning Support policy has been devised by the SENCos and Deputy Head Learning and Wellbeing, in consultation with the DHAs. It is reviewed annually.

To do this it is crucial that every child attend The Prep every day and on time. This policy sets out how together we will achieve this and takes into account Keeping Children Safe in Education (2025) and Working Together to Improve Attendance (2024). The attendance lead at The Prep is the Deputy Head, Pastoral. Why regular attendance is so important Any absence affects the pattern of a student’s learning and regular absence will seriously affect their progress. Any pupil’s absence disrupts teaching routines and so may affect the learning of others in the same class. Ensuring a child’s regular attendance at The Prep is a parent’s legal responsibility and permitting absence from The Prep without a good reason is an offence in law and may result in prosecution. Every pupil should aim to have a minimum of 95% attendance. Anything less than this will impact on their education. Through the academic year we monitor absences and punctuality to show us where improvements need to be made. Should we have any concerns, pastoral leaders will work closely with parents to address any issues. Promoting regular attendance Helping to create a pattern of regular attendance is everybody’s responsibility – parent / guardian/carers, pupils, and all members of Prep School staff. To help us all to focus on this The Prep will: • Give details of attendance on request; • Report to parents each half term regarding their child’s attendance Understanding types of absence Every half-day absence from The Prep must be classified by The Prep (not by the parent / carers), as either AUTHORISED or UNAUTHORISED. Therefore, information about the cause of any absence is always required, preferably in writing. Authorised absences are mornings or afternoons away from The Prep for a good reason like illness, medical/dental appointments or extra-curricular activities which unavoidably fall in school time, emergencies, or other unavoidable cause. Unauthorised absences are those which The Prep does not consider reasonable and for which no “leave\" has been given. This type of absence is often asked for in educational references and in extreme circumstances – missing 10 registration contact points without explanation – may have to be reported to the Local Education Authority (LEA) or the UKVI (UK visas and Immigration). Examples include: • Parents/carers keeping children off school unnecessarily • Absences which are not properly explained • Any event in term time which have not been agreed. Whilst any child may be off school because they are ill, sometimes they can be reluctant to attend school. In this situation it is essential that the parents do not give in to pressure and allow students to stay away from The Prep. This gives the impression that attendance does not matter and usually make things worse. The Prep works to support parent / carers to ensure that the child returns to school. If a pupil is ill for 5 days in a row and no Doctor’s note is provided, this will likely be classed as unauthorised absence and could trigger a report to the LEA or UKVI. Persistent Absence (PA) A student becomes a ‘persistent absentee’ when they miss 10% of lessons across The Prep School year for whatever reason. Absence at this level is doing considerable damage to any child’s educational prospects and should be treated as a safeguarding issue. We therefore need parents’ full support and co-operation to tackle this. PA pupils, and those at risk of becoming PA are tracked and monitored carefully through our pastoral system and we also combine this with academic mentoring where absence affects attainment. The attached appendix gives a summary of the stages and steps The Prep will take with persistent absentees. Absence Procedures If a child is absent parents must: • Contact the form teacher and/or the school office as soon as possible on the first day of absence.

Absence Procedures If a child is absent parents must: • Contact the form teacher and/or the school office as soon as possible on the first day of absence. If a child is absent The Prep will: • Attempt to telephone or text parents on the first day of absence if we have not heard from them • Invite parents in to discuss the situation with the form taker, Head of Section, Head of Pupil Welfare or one of the Deputy Heads if absence persists If a child’s attendance drops below 90%, the school will be in touch with parents to understand any specific issue and to agree on how we can work together to improve attendance. Contact details There are times when we need to contact parents about lots of things, including absence, so we need to have accurate contact details and numbers at all times. Please ensure The Prep is informed immediately of any changes. There will be regular checks on telephone numbers throughout the year. Lateness Poor punctuality is not acceptable. Pupils who are late disrupt their own progress and the learning of others. How we manage lateness: Form time – unless at an authorised activity or appointment pupils are expected to be registered by their form taker at 8:15 If a pupil has a record of persistent lateness, they and the parents will be asked to meet with a senior teacher to resolve the problem, but parents can approach The Prep at any time if they are having problems getting their child to school on time. Holidays in term time Taking holidays in term time will affect a pupil’s schooling as much as any other absence and we expect parents to help us by not taking children away in term time. There is no automatic entitlement in law to time off in term time to go on holiday. Holiday absences may be authorised in certain circumstances at the head’s discretion. Any application for leave must be made in advance to the Head. In making a decision, the Head will consider the circumstances of each application individually, including any previous pattern of leave in term time and your child’s overall attendance record. Circumstances where such leave will be authorised: Examples of where leave in term time may be authorised include, but are not limited to:- • Weddings of parents and siblings. • The funeral of a parent or sibling or any other compassionate incident • Where an absence from The Prep is recommended by a health professional as part of a parent or child’s rehabilitation from a medical or emotional issue. A health professional’s letter will need to be seen by the Head. • If a parent is service personnel and is returning from a tour of duty abroad where it is evidenced the individual will not be in receipt of any leave in the near future that coincides with Prep School holidays. • Early departure of pupils due to personal reasons • Religious holidays • Passport and Visa Interviews This list is not exhaustive.

Parent / Carers • All non-urgent appointments to be arranged after Prep School at the weekend or in school holidays. • The Prep should be informed in advance or on the day of reasons for absence. • A reason for every absence to be given to the Prep School either in writing, via email or by telephone (usually to the form taker). Prep Admin Office • Updating the registers when notification is received regarding reason for absence • Daily monitoring of am / pm registration – recording where registers not taken • Provide DHP/Head of Section with a list of students to receive Warning letters re attendance • Contact parent / carers in writing where a student has an unauthorised absence for 10 consecutive days Head of Wellbeing • Facilitate support for pupils experiencing mental health problems which is causing issues with attendance. • Engage with parents at an early stage to support their child experiencing anxiety to ensure robust support for the child. • Support parents if they feel the child needs to visit a specialist in relation to a mental health concern. • Refer to Early Help if consent has been agreed.

Introduction The school has written procedures identifying action to be taken when a child is absent without authority. These procedures are known to staff, pupils and their parents or guardians (through the Prep website). • The procedures cover the following: Searching for any pupil missing or believed to have run away from The Prep or as a result of a possible abduction to include the timing of reporting pupil missing to: • The Police • To the pupil’s parents or guardians (if appropriate). • Take action to obtain information about the whereabouts of a missing pupil and to try to ensure: • The safety and welfare of that pupil • The collection and return of missing pupil when found • Action to be taken on the pupil’s return. All staff are aware of, and do not exceed, the measures they may properly take to prevent a pupil leaving without permission under current legislation (section 93 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006) and government guidance on the use of force, (see Use of Reasonable Force policy). 2 Missing Child Protocol Stage Medical (Self Certified by parents) Trigger Pupils missing 5 days in"}

Appendix 4 Procedures where a mental health issue is affecting attendance. The following guidance is applied to any pupil displaying social, emotional and mental health issues that is affecting their attendance. It is not only for pupils who have a diagnosed mental health disorder, or a disability or a special educational need. All actions taken to support attendance are referred to as “reasonable adjustments” and this term is used as a way of describing actions in general terms, as opposed to a school’s duty to make reasonable adjustments for pupils with a disability under section 20 of the 2010 Equality Act. Parents/carers have a duty, under section 7 of the Education Act 1996, to ensure that their child of compulsory school age (5 to 16) receives an efficient full-time education either by attendance at school or otherwise, and so share in the responsibility of ensuring good and regular attendance. As such, we encourage parents/carers to be open and work with the school to create a plan for attendance that fits with the needs of the child. Any reasonable adjustments or support put in place should ensure that the time the child spends in school is prioritised as much as is possible. Where support offered is not engaged with, or where all other options have been exhausted or deemed inappropriate, the school will consider whether this meets the threshold for referral to external agencies. While it is the legal responsibility of all parents/carers to ensure their child receives education by full-time attendance at school or otherwise, in very exceptional circumstances, where it is in a pupil’s best interests, a plan to help a child to attend may involve the use of a temporary part-time timetable to meet their individual needs. For example, where a medical condition (including a mental health condition) prevents a pupil from attending school full-time and a part-time timetable is considered as part of a re-integration package. Any part-time timetable will seek to maximise face-to-face school time as much as possible. While the School will consider providing remote education to help pupils stay on track, this will not be of the same standard as face-to-face class based learning and should therefore only be a temporary measure, used as part of a plan to reintegrate a pupil back into full time education.

Such support is known as a bursary and bursaries may be awarded in the form of a discount of the tuition fees payable depending on financial circumstances, compassionate or other pertinent circumstances of applicants. In exceptional circumstances, assistance with ‘extras’ (e.g. school uniform, trips and tours etc.) may also be considered. Where status of pupils changes (for example from full boarder to day boarder) the school reserves the right to review the level of bursary. Bursary awards are reviewed annually and may be varied, increased, decreased or withdrawn depending on the recipient’s financial circumstances. Cheltenham College considers each application on its own merit and awards are based upon such things as savings, investments and realisable assets as well as income, dependents, compassionate and other pertinent factors. Requests for financial support usually fall into two categories: • New applicants to Cheltenham College where a place has been offered but the family is unable to fund the school fees in full • Current pupils, where the parents’ circumstances have changed resulting in difficulties in meeting the tuition fees and may result in the pupil being withdrawn part way through a stage of education. New Applicants to Cheltenham College Cheltenham College provides information about its bursaries in the following locations: • Cheltenham College prospectus • Cheltenham College website • On occasions, by advertisement or other appropriate marketing media. The Application Process 2 Bursaries may be available to parents of children entering all stages of Cheltenham College (but it should be noted that awards to pupils entering Pre-Prep and the early years of Cheltenham Prep are unusual). They are awarded at the discretion of the Council; the Head and the Bursar (acting as the Subventions Committee) are responsible for the management and co-ordination of the process. Parents are required to complete a ‘Confidential Statement of Financial Circumstances’ with the details of the financial circumstances of the household. The form, which requests details of income and capital, must be accompanied by full documentary evidence, and is available upon request from the Bursar’s Office at bursar@cheltenhamcollege.org Cheltenham College strongly recommends that applications are made well in advance and parents should note that applications received later than the end of January immediately preceding the September of commencement will only be considered in exceptional circumstances. Cheltenham College where appropriate employs the services of external agencies to assess some applications that it receives. This work is carried out in the strictest confidence and may include visits to parents at their home at their convenience. A report is then prepared and sent to College; the Director of Finance submits this to the Subventions Committee for a decision. Cheltenham College then writes to parents to confirm the outcome of its assessment and the level and terms of any bursary awarded. In other circumstances Cheltenham College will carry out its own financial review which may include a meeting with parents. Any personal data shared with partner agencies will be processed in accordance with Data Protection legislation. All bursary awards are subject to the pupil achieving the required level in the entrance examination; such an award does not guarantee entry to Cheltenham College. Bursary recipients will similarly be expected to reach the normal attainment level to progress to take A levels at College. Where pupils are offered academic or other awards (for example music or sports scholarships) the value of these awards will be considered alongside bursaries, based on the financial circumstances of the pupil. The Case for Assistance A number of factors are considered when assessing the justification for support and the extent to which this might extend. In most cases, the suitability of the pupil for College"}

Bursary recipients will similarly be expected to reach the normal attainment level to progress to take A levels at College. Where pupils are offered academic or other awards (for example music or sports scholarships) the value of these awards will be considered alongside bursaries, based on the financial circumstances of the pupil. The Case for Assistance A number of factors are considered when assessing the justification for support and the extent to which this might extend. In most cases, the suitability of the pupil for College is the first consideration in granting an award. • Suitability – In assessing a child’s suitability, Cheltenham College considers the academic assessment as well as actual achievement. Bursary funds are limited and those judged most likely to benefit from a College education will be given priority. Each pupil to whom support is offered must, in the opinion of the Head, be likely to make sound academic progress following admission, possess the potential to develop the quality of his/her work and benefit from participation in the wider extra-curricular activities on offer in College. Applicants are required to meet Cheltenham College’s normal academic requirements and previous school reports will be consulted for good behaviour. • Financial Limitations – The amount of the bursary award is not influenced by the level of the academic ability of the child but the extent of need. Each application is assessed on its own merit and awards are made accordingly, subject to the limited funds available. It is recognised that judgements about the sacrifices a family should make to pay school fees are subjective but Cheltenham College has a duty to ensure that all bursary awards are well focused and therefore as well as current earnings, the following factors will be taken into account: o Any potential for improving the financial position of the family; for example, where there are two spouses or partners, both would be expected to be employed unless one is prevented 3 from doing so through incapacity, the need to care for children under school age, other dependents or the requirements of the other spouse or partner’s work. o Opportunities to release capital. Cheltenham College would expect significant capital savings and investments to be used for the payment of school fees, as would any significant realisable equity in property. o Where parents are separated, the contribution of the absent parent o Contributions to household costs by other wider family members, any adults unrelated to the child or by outside sources o Where fees are being paid to other schools or universities (if fees are being paid, or will be paid to another independent school), College will require to see evidence that an application for assistance has also been made to that school. Whilst acknowledging that others may not share its view, College considers that the following would not be consistent with the receipt of a bursary: o Frequent or expensive holidays o New or luxury cars o Investment in significant home improvements o A second property/land holdings o Taking on increased borrowings to fund property purchase o Significant regular expenditure on costly non-essential leisure pursuits & pastimes Other Factors It is recognised that in addition to academic ability, there may be other circumstances which should be considered. These include: • Where a child has siblings at Cheltenham College • Where the social needs of the child are relevant (e.g. they may be suffering from bullying at their present school) • Where a parent of a current pupil is terminally ill or is unable to secure permanent employment due to poor health • Where a separation has resulted in a current pupil having to be withdrawn from Cheltenham College, adding to the stress of coping with the parents’ separation. Current Pupils – Change in Family Circumstances Cheltenham College understands the importance of continuity for the pupils in its care and welcomes applications for financial assistance where parents’ circumstances have changed. The application process is set out above and application forms are available from the Bursar’s Office at bursar@cheltenhamcollege.org and the completed application form should be accompanied by the relevant documentation when returned to the"}

The application process is set out above and application forms are available from the Bursar’s Office at bursar@cheltenhamcollege.org and the completed application form should be accompanied by the relevant documentation when returned to the Fees Office. The process for assessing such applications is set out above; and College will contact parents to arrange a mutually convenient time for their visit if this is necessary. Awards are subject to the availability of funds; although it is unable to guarantee support, Cheltenham College does its best to assist parents of current pupils whenever possible. Annual Review All bursary awards are subject to annual review and may be varied depending upon parental circumstances. Bursary holders may be provided with a Confidential Statement of Financial Circumstances form at the time of the review (normally during the Spring Term) for return within 14 days. College may need to make arrangements to meet parents before submitting a report for the Subventions Committee to consider. The Committee has the discretion to recommend whether or not a reduction or withdrawal of an award is appropriate, not only where a pupil’s progress attitude or behaviour have been unsatisfactory but also where parents have failed to support Cheltenham College, 4 for example through regular late/non-payment of any contribution they are making towards school fees and ‘extras’. In any event, a term’s notice will be given if an award is to be reduced or withdrawn. Confidentiality Cheltenham College and its agents fully respect the confidentiality of bursary awards made to families and expects that families and other recipients will do likewise. Other Sources of Bursary Assistance In addition to Cheltenham College’s bursary fund there are a number of educational and charitable trusts, which provide assistance with tuition fees. In the majority of cases these are to assist children who are already attending a fee-paying school and due to a change of circumstances may be unable to remain. Cheltenham College encourages parents to apply for support where it is felt a good case may be made for assistance.

The accompanying CCTV Privacy Impact Assessment is available on Cheltenham College website. 1. Purpose of the CCTV Policy The purpose of this policy is to formalise the use of Closed-Circuit Television and its associated technology in the monitoring of both the internal and external areas of Cheltenham College premises. CCTV is installed in Cheltenham College premises to enhance the safety and security of pupils, staff and visitors, as well as to secure our buildings, heritage and assets. Cheltenham College CCTV operates 24-hours a day throughout the year. CCTV surveillance at Cheltenham College is intended for the purposes of: • Enhancing the health and safety of pupils, staff, and visitors • Supporting safeguarding of pupils and visiting pupils • Preventing bullying; • Reducing the incidence of crime and anti-social behaviour (including theft and vandalism) • Protecting Cheltenham College, its buildings, assets, finances, and reputation • Supporting the Police to deter and detect crime • Assisting in identifying, apprehending and prosecuting offenders • Ensuring that the school rules are respected so that the school can be properly managed. • Monitoring safety on crossing points on roads surrounding Cheltenham College 2. Scope This policy relates to the location, use, monitoring, recording of cameras and subsequent use of CCTV recorded material. 3. General Principles 2 Cheltenham College has statutory responsibilities to protect its people, heritage and assets, as well as providing reassurance to employees, students and visitors. Cheltenham College owes a duty of care, under the provisions of Health, Safety and Welfare at Work etc Act 1974, and uses CCTV as an added layer of safety and security. This enhances the quality of life of the school community, by integrating good practice in the use of CCTV surveillance of its premises and surrounding areas. Sitting at the core of Cheltenham College’s approach to CCTV, are the key Cheltenham College policies that underpin the principles of pupil safety and professional conduct of staff. Therefore, CCTV monitoring of public areas for security purposes is conducted in a manner consistent with these underpinning policies; • Key - Behaviour Policy • Key - Child Protection and Safeguarding • Key - Keeping Children Safe in Education • Key - Staff Code of Conduct • Key - Whistleblowing Policy • Data Protection Policy • Privacy Notices for Pupils, Staff. Parents, Guardians and Cheltonian Society Members • Equality and Diversity Policy • Dignity at Work Policy • Health and Safety Policy • Fire Safety Policy CCTV use is conducted in a professional and ethical manner and use of CCTV for purposes, other than stated in this policy, are prohibited. This is underpinned by Cheltenham College CCTV Privacy Impact Assessment. The College Privacy Notice for Pupils, Parents, Guardians and Cheltonian Society members can be found on the following link; https://www.cheltenhamcollege.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Privacy-Notice-for-Pupils-Parents-Guardians-and-Cheltonian-Society-Members-CC-2.pdf Information obtained through the CCTV system may only be released to a third party when authorised by the Bursar. Any requests for CCTV recordings/images from the Police will be recorded and legal advice may be sought if such a request is made. (See “Access” below). A Police Officer may be required to obtain a warrant for the material and accordingly any such request made by the Police should be in writing. CCTV monitoring within Cheltenham College premises is limited to uses that do not violate the individual’s reasonable expectation to privacy. Information, obtained in breach of this policy, may not be used in a disciplinary proceeding against an employee pupil or visitor of Cheltenham College. All CCTV systems and associated equipment are compliant with this policy. Recognisable images captured by CCTV systems are “personal data.” They are therefore subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Acts 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation. 3 When CCTV cameras are introduced in new locations, an"}

All CCTV systems and associated equipment are compliant with this policy. Recognisable images captured by CCTV systems are “personal data.” They are therefore subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Acts 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation. 3 When CCTV cameras are introduced in new locations, an application will be made for approval by the Bursar and staff will be notified. Where systems are already in operation, their operation is reviewed annually. 4. Justification for the use of CCTV The General Data Protection Regulation (principle c) requires that data is \"adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary\" for the purpose for which it is processed. This means that Cheltenham College needs to justify the capture and use of personal data by means of a CCTV system. The use of CCTV to monitor common walkways, buildings, interior areas and the perimeter of Cheltenham College, for safety and security purposes, has been deemed to be justified by Cheltenham College. The system is intended to capture images of intruders or of individuals damaging property or removing goods without authorisation, it also supports safeguarding principles. CCTV systems will not be used to monitor normal teacher/pupil classroom activity in Cheltenham College. In other areas of the school where CCTV has been installed, e.g. reception areas, library, common rooms and restaurants, it has been demonstrated that there is a risk to security, discipline and/or health & safety and that the installation of CCTV is proportionate in addressing such issues. 5. Location of Cameras The location of cameras is a key consideration for Cheltenham College. CCTV monitoring, where individuals would have a reasonable expectation of privacy, is not permitted by this policy. Cheltenham College has endeavoured to select locations for the installation of CCTV cameras which are least intrusive and protect the privacy of individuals. Cameras placed to record external areas are positioned in such a way as to prevent or minimise recording of passers-by or of another person's private property. Locations of cameras are contained in CCTV Privacy Impact Assessment. CCTV Video Monitoring and Recording of Public Areas include the following: • Protection of school buildings and property: Building perimeters, entrances and exits, receptions, lobbies, corridors, stairwells, and storage areas • Monitoring of Access Control Systems: Monitor and record restricted access areas at entrances to buildings and other areas • Verification of Security Alarms: Intrusion alarms, exit door controls, external alarms • Video Patrol of Public Areas: Quad, front driveway, parking areas, minibus parking area, main entrance/exit gates and driveways • Criminal Investigations (carried out by the Police): Robbery, burglary and theft surveillance • Internal areas of Pupil and Staff Assembly: Assembly halls, sports facilities, library, Upper College Common Room, restaurants, serveries, and coffee shop • Monitoring of pupil safety on traffic controlled pedestrian crossings: Thirlestaine Road, Sandford Road and College Lawn Junction 6. Covert Surveillance Cheltenham College does not engage in covert surveillance. 4 Where Police request to carry out covert surveillance on school premises, this will be requested in writing and will require approval by the Bursar, who may seek legal advice. 7. Notification and Signage Adequate signage is placed at locations where CCTV cameras are sited. Appropriate locations for signage include: • At entrances to premises i.e. external doors, school gates • Reception areas • Pedestrian Crossings 8. Storage and Retention The General Data Protection Regulation (Principle e) states that data shall be kept \"for no longer than is necessary for\" the purposes for which it was obtained. Ordinarily CCTV images are stored for 30 days before being written over. However, where images identify an issue - for example a crime or health and safety matter, then those particular images/recordings will be retained for an investigation/prosecution of that issue. Digital recordings are stored in a secure environment with a log of access to stored data is kept. Access is restricted to authorised personnel. Data held on NVR (Network Video"}

Data held on NVR (Network Video Recorders) hard drive is fully encrypted and data is protected by admin password which include access by IP address. 9. Access Access and maintenance of the CCTV System is the responsibility of Cheltenham College. The administration of the CCTV System is delegated to the Head of Security and Portering. When CCTV recordings are being viewed, access is limited to authorised individuals on a need-to-know basis. Access to the CCTV system and stored images is restricted to authorised SIA CCTV Licensed personnel only. In relevant circumstances, CCTV footage may be accessed for: • Following a request by the Police when a crime or suspected crime has taken place • The HSE or statutory body charged with child safeguarding • The Head in establishing facts in cases of unacceptable pupil behaviour, in which case, the parents/guardians will be informed • Heads of Department, Housemasters/mistresses and functional leads to support investigations, trend analysis and support safety and safeguarding • Data subjects (or their legal representatives), subject to an access request • Individuals (or their legal representatives) subject to a court order 5 • Cheltenham College insurers Requests by the Police: Information obtained through CCTV monitoring will only be released when authorised by the Bursar, in cases, this may require consultation with the President of Council and may take legal advice. If the Police request CCTV images for a specific investigation, any such request should be made in writing or by a warrant. Access requests: On written request, any person whose image has been recorded may view a copy of the information recorded which relates to them, provided that such an image/recording exists i.e. has not been deleted and provided also that an exemption/prohibition does not apply to the release. Where the image/recording identifies another individual, those images may only be released where they can be redacted/anonymised so that the other person is not identified or identifiable. To exercise their right of access, a data subject must make an application in writing to the Bursar. Cheltenham College (with the guidance of the Data Protection Lead where necessary) will respond to such a request within one month. A person should provide all the necessary information to assist Cheltenham College in locating the CCTV recorded data, including the date, time, and location of the recording. If the image does not clearly identify an individual, that image may not be personal data and may not be handed over by Cheltenham College. In giving a person a copy of their data, Cheltenham College may provide relevant images. However, Cheltenham College may not be able to give copies of all images if it is not possible to obscure images (and therefore the right to privacy) of other individuals. 10. Responsibilities; Cheltenham College will: • Ensure that the use of CCTV systems is implemented in accordance with this policy • Oversee and co-ordinate the use of CCTV monitoring for safety and security purposes within Cheltenham College • Ensure that the CCTV monitoring system is evaluated for compliance with this policy • Ensure that the CCTV monitoring at Cheltenham College is consistent with the standards and protections contained in this policy • Review camera locations and be responsible for the release of any information or recorded CCTV materials stored in compliance with this policy • Maintain a record of access (e.g. an access log) to or the release of tapes or any material recorded or stored in the system • Consider both pupils and staff feedback/complaints regarding possible invasion of privacy or confidentiality due to the location of a particular CCTV camera or associated equipment • Ensure that all areas being"}

Implementation and Review The policy and its privacy impact statement will be reviewed annually. On-going review and evaluation should consider any changing information or guidelines, for example, from the Information Commissioner’s Office, Police, Department of Education, Independent Schools Inspectorate, national guidelines and feedback from parents/guardians, pupils, staff and others. 7 APPENDIX DEFINITIONS Definitions of words/phrases used in relation to the protection of personal data and referred to in the text of the policy; • Authorised personnel – Members of Cheltenham College staff who hold a Security Industry Authority licence. • CCTV – Closed-circuit television is the use of video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place on a limited set of monitors.

The relationship between pupil, parent and House, will be fundamental to this and communication is encouraged to be frequent and open. A Cheltenham College House should be a place where all pupils can study, play and rest, and there should be a real sense of community and mutual respect. Pupils should develop responsibility for themselves and others, fostering their individuality whilst respecting the individuality of others. We encourage all to be resilient and to develop a positive attitude when faced with challenges, to be confident but not arrogant, to respect and show consideration towards the immediate and wider community in which we live, and to take advantage of the opportunities offered to them."}
{"url": "https://cheltenham-college.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/30122253/Key-Pupil-Behaviour-Policy-C.pdf", "text": "Pupil Behaviour Policy (C) Reviewer: James Hayden/Anna Cutts Approver: Nicola Huggett Reviewed: May 2025 Next Review: May 2026 Last approved by Council: November 2024 Purpose of the policy At Cheltenham College, we are committed to establishing a safe and caring environment according to our aims and values, where the happiness, safety and confidence of pupils are given the highest priority. This policy will be reviewed and approved by the school’s governing body (known as Council) on an annual basis. Our aim is that through the implementation of this policy, the school community should be able to recognise and understand what behaviour is expected and why. Rewarding positive conduct and work should always be the first priority of the school and unacceptable behaviour should not be allowed to impact on the well-being of others. This policy applies to all pupils at Cheltenham College and should, where relevant, be read in conjunction with the following policies: · Keeping Children Safe in Education · Child Protection and Safeguarding · Alcohol · Smoking and Vaping · Controlled Drugs · House Principles · Search and Confiscation · Restraint and Reasonable Force · Anti-bullying · E Safety · Pupil ICT Acceptable Use · Relationships Policy · Child on Child Abuse Policy · Exclusions College standards and expectations It is the expectation that all pupils at Cheltenham College will behave in a way that is civilised and civilising; that they will treat all in our community (both within school and the wider community) with kindness, tolerance and respect; that they will not embarrass themselves, others or bring Cheltenham College into disrepute. Cheltenham College strives to nurture a ‘child safe’ culture; sexism, racism, misogyny/misandry, homophobia, biphobia, sexual harassment and sexual violence and child-on-child abuse, including in any intimate relationship are not tolerated. This extends to on-line communications or social media posts. Additionally, it is expected that Cheltonians will abide by the letter, as well as the spirit, of Cheltenham College’s ‘rules and regulations’. These might include, for example, the Classroom Code of Conduct, the College Rules, rules about ‘town’ and ‘bounds’, routine instructions provided by staff and coaches, and other College policies relating to behaviour. All pupils who are new to College are inducted in College’s expectations regarding behaviour. Although College’s ‘rules and regulations’ relate primarily to school life during term time, there are circumstances in which behaviour ‘off campus’ and, indeed, out of term time will be dealt with by this, and related policies. These would typically include any behaviour that could bring Cheltenham College into disrepute or which has a serious impact on the school community or individuals within it, in either its physical or online environment. The over-arching expectation is one of community, consideration, mutual respect and common sense. It is generally accepted that while sanctions can help to discourage and contain poor behaviour, it can have only a limited effect on the promotion of good behaviour. The Cheltonian Charter is an agreed set of values, reviewed by Pupil Council, that underpins our behaviour policy and promotes a culture of kindness and consideration, tolerance, and respect. It provides a framework for all Cheltonians to aspire to. Cheltenham College will always look to promote positive discipline and recognise and celebrate the good that pupils do, rather than using sanctions; corporal punishment is never used. If any Cheltenham College pupil behaves in a way which raises concern with any member of staff, that behaviour should be addressed predictably, promptly and assertively as soon as possible. The aim of any response to misbehaviour should be to maintain the culture of the school so that all pupils can thrive in a safe, calm and happy environment.

The Assistant Head Pastoral, Senior Housemaster, Housemasters and Housemistresses, academic teaching staff and matrons would be the staff who would actually issue a sanction if appropriate. In the event of an outbreak of illness, pupils are expected to comply with any necessary infection control measures put in place to protect themselves and others. Responsibilities All staff are introduced to the College behaviour policy at induction and refresher training and updates are given annually at INSET and throughout the year where necessary. In addition, staff should: • In the first instance, all staff should look to manage any issue that arises directly and to follow the College sanctions policy. • More serious individual behavioural concerns, or repeated poor behaviour, should be shared with the Housemaster or Housemistress, who will in turn liaise with the Senior Housemaster and / or Assisstant Head Pastoral where appropriate. • Poor behaviour by an individual in the classroom (including incidents of plagiarism) should be referred to the HoD and sanctioned accordingly. In all incidents the HsM should be copied into communication. • Staff should always look to consider what lies behind any behaviour, so that the reasons or causes can be fully understood and supported. • Staff should be particularly mindful adapting their behaviour management of any pupil with SEND/Pupils of Concern information to ascertain whether strategies specific to these children’s needs should be employed for more effective behaviour management. • Should be particularly mindful adapting their behaviour management of any pupil with SEND, and should liaise with Learning Support staff to ascertain whether strategies specific to these children’s needs should be employed for more effective behaviour management. • Ensure that all Cheltonians understand what is meant by good behaviour, based on the Classroom Code of Conduct and the Cheltonian Charter. • Ensure that the reason for a rule is clearly explained • Be consistent in rewards and sanctions and ensure such actions are communicated to the appropriate members of staff. • Avoid ‘blanket’ punishments • Communicate with parents as appropriate. • Model desired behaviour • Written and verbal feedback to pupils should reflect (but not be confined to) the examples set out in the Rewards and Sanctions guidance that is appended to this policy. Support • The Assistant Head (Welfare and Safeguarding) in liaison with the Deputy Head Learning and Wellbeing, will issue specific advice on managing and supporting individual pupils with specific needs. • Pupils who have been sanctioned for more serious disciplinary matters, may need support in ensuring these behaviours do not reoccur. Strategies such as a Behavioural Contact, Counselling support, or interventions from external agencies may be employed if deemed necessary. How College deals with racism Cheltenham College welcomes the diversity of cultures, backgrounds, faiths and beliefs and celebrates the home languages, dialects and accents of all pupils, staff and others associated with the school. College seeks to promote racial harmony and prepare our pupils for life beyond College in a diverse and increasingly inter-dependent society. In addition, it is a legal requirement to “eliminate unlawful racial discrimination and promote equality of opportunity, and good relations......” (Sec 71 Race Relations Act 1976). College expects all pupils from whatever background or heritage, to find our school a safe and welcoming community and behaviours of a racist nature, whether overt or more indirect (examples could include incidents of prejudice or stereotyping), must be thoroughly investigated and reported promptly to the Assistant Head Pastoral. In line with our Child-on-Child abuse policy and Anti-Bullying policy, the circumstance of the incident, the voice of the ‘harmed’, and"}

In line with our Child-on-Child abuse policy and Anti-Bullying policy, the circumstance of the incident, the voice of the ‘harmed’, and any known vulnerability will, if applicable, be taken into consideration in determining the level of sanction. In all cases, education is key to minimising the risk of reoccurrence. Use of restorative practice involving the AR team where appropriate, possible intervention from external agencies or organisations, and follow up review meetings with the respective Housemaster or Housemistress form an important role in ensuring that College nurtures all individuals and cultivates an ethos where all are valued, and views are listened to. This embraces a culture that enables all in our community to review their practices and behaviours and to build on prior experiences and to make appropriate changes. In very serious cases, it may be necessary to report an individual(s) to the police or to Channel (See Prevent Policy). In order to minimise misconception or doubt, Cheltenham College considers the use of N word or P word to be unacceptable by any member of its community, whatever their racial identity or circumstance. This includes articulating the word when teaching particular material or playing music which contains such words. Appendix 1 – Cheltonian Charter The Cheltonian Charter is drawn up by the Pupil Leadership Team each year in collaboration with Pupil Voice. This document is reviewed annually as we develop as a school community. The Cheltonian Charter 2024-25 Charity Fun Run!The Reeling Ball The Cheltonian charter is founded on two of the five core values of College, Character and Community. It is an expectation that as a Cheltonian, every pupil has an understanding of, and aims to follow the principles of this charter during their time at College. This charter provides a framework which underpins a culture of kindness and courtesy, tolerance and respect. By becoming a Cheltonian, it is important that we all clearly understand these principles and as such help to make College the special community that it is. C O U R T E S Y Manners Matter, at College we say good morning or hello, we notice, we show interest, and offer our appreciation. • We greet visitors, smile, shake hands and hold doors open.• We thank caterers, cleaners and estates staff, visiting teams or speakers.• Write polite emails that consider our audience, are correctly addressed and signed off.• We step up when someone needs our help and we step down when someone else needs an opportunity.Character and Community Senior Boys’ Tennis House Pots I N T E G R I T YCheltonians should consider the impact their behaviour can have on others and the environment. • We want to build a sustainable future.

Introduction Cheltenham College gives priority to encouraging the development of personal potential, especially in relation to the school’s core principles of Community, Character, Continuous excellence, Creativity and Curiosity. This policy describes the means through which the school celebrates not only pupils’ successes and achievements but also pupils’ commitment, dedication and service to others. Through recognising and rewarding pupil endeavour, College demonstrates that pupils are valued. It is important that the reward system should promote positive behaviour, motivating pupils in their attitude to learning, their participation in the life of College and their contribution to the lives of others. Praise and recognition can be offered informally as well as formally; positive, sincere feedback should be integral to the school’s endeavour to facilitate personal development. The rewards policy describes awards earned by pupils whose performance in a range of areas is above and beyond the norm, whether that be in relation to progress, attainment, caring for others, service, leadership, responsibility or specific achievements. 2. Rewarding good behaviour 2.1 This policy describes a comprehensive reward structure built on commendations that are awarded for academic effort and attainment as well as co-curricular contribution. 2.2 College recognises the incredible contribution made by pupils through its reward structure, that culminates in the awards of House Shields, House Pots trophies, House and Club ties and full and half Colours. Some of the key elements of this reward structure are outlined below. 2.3 Informal rewards College prides itself on the quality of the relationship between staff and pupils and saying ‘thank you’ and ‘well done’ should be a routine part of school life for all members of the community. 2.4 Commendations These are a formal way to recognise a positive contribution. 1. Values Commendation This can be awarded by any member of staff for any positive contribution made by a pupil, in or out of the classroom. College recognizes the importance of noticing and affirming positive behaviour in order to create a culture of positive behaviour that permeates across the many areas in which pupils are involved; socially, in the House setting and in their co-curricular activities, to name just a few. A Values Commendation can be awarded in relation to the school’s five core values. Some examples are included below. • Community: Awarded by a member of staff on duty in the Dining Hall at lunchtime to a pupil who noticed another pupil sitting alone and went over and invited the pupil to come join their group • Character: Awarded by a Sports Professional to a pupil who remained calm and polite to a player in a competitor school team whose actions were provocative •"}

College Commendation These are awarded by a teacher to any pupil for a piece of work or effort, notable for that pupil, or for sustained attainment and effort. Commendations are entered onto the school’s database. At the end of each term, pupils who have acquired the highest number of Commendations are awarded a prize (in the form of tokens) at the Head’s Assembly. The Heads of Lower and Upper College also identify pupils who have acquired an increased number of Commendations, achieved a significant higher Attitude To Learning (ATL) score, or made significant improvement, to receive prizes for endeavour. 2.5 Head’s Distinctions Distinctions will reward exceptional work characterised by intellectual rigour, imagination and research. They are not ‘super Commendations’. Distinctions will be awarded for normal term work or for coursework. These are rare: it is to be expected that between 2 and 5 will be awarded during a term. Nominations can be made by any teacher, and should be referred to the Head of Department (HOD), who will make the judgement about what represents Distinction-level work. The HOD sends the work with his/her recommendation to the Deputy Head (Academic) who will often wish to see the pupil concerned to discuss the work. The names of those receiving Distinctions and the titles of the work are recorded in a Distinctions Book in the Library. Distinctions will be recognised at the Head’s end of term assembly. 2.6 Academic Colours Academic Colours are intended to reward both Attitude to Learning and Attainment, and are a prestigious award. The award is based on a points system. Half Colours are awarded to any pupil reaching 200 points; Full Colours are awarded to any scoring more than 400. Academic high-flyers who make an exceptional effort should be receiving Half Colours during Fifth Form and going on to Full Colours by the Upper Sixth; the very hard-working who score less strongly in exams will attain Half Colours by the Upper Sixth. The points system works as follows: • Pupils receive 10 points for any Report Card where they have a score between 3.6 and 4.0. • Pupils receive 20 points for any Report Card where they have a score of 4.1 or above. • Lower College pupils receive 5 points for each Grade 7 result in Fourth Form Summer Exams, GCSE Mocks or final GCSEs. • Lower College pupils receive 10 points for each Grade 8 or 9 in Fourth Form Summer Exams, GCSE Mocks or final GCSEs. • Upper College pupils receive 10 points for each A grade or Distinction result in Lower Sixth Summer Exams and Upper Sixth Mocks, and 20 points for each A* or Distinction*. • Pupils joining College in Lower Sixth are awarded double points for their GCSE results so that they have the chance to acquire Academic Colours during their two years at College. Full Colours ties are presented in Head’s Assemblies, and Half Colours are presented in year group or House assemblies.

Sports, Music, Drama, CCF and Club Ties and Colours Many different aspects of life at College are recognised by the award of Colours and Ties. Many of these are presented in Head’s or Year group assemblies. Permission for the creation of a new tie must be sought through the Deputy Head (Co-Curricular). House Ties Each House awards House ties for specific contributions to the life of the House and the wider College community. Details of these are available from each individual House. Appendix 3 - Sanctions Breaches of College Behaviour and Discipline General principles Staff should use sanctions to help pupils to see the error of their actions and how they can correct their behaviour. Staff should refer to the Core College values: Community, Creativity, Curiosity, Character and Continuous Excellence. Sanctions should include an element of reflection in order to avoid future repetition or escalation. Sanctions There are different levels of sanction dependent on the seriousness of the incident. (Level 1) Verbal For most initial behaviour issues a verbal conversation between a member of staff and pupils is the most appropriate course of action. At a suitable time staff should verbally re-emphasize how the pupil behaviour is not upholding College values, explain the error and potential for sanction. (Level 2) Sanctions at this level could accumulate towards a punishment but are mainly used to inform tutors, Hsms and Heads of Section where behaviour or work has fallen below basic expectations. Notifications These are a communication device and a chance to inform tutor and HsM, and remind the pupil, of work required. A teacher can also request a pupil comes to a classroom to re-sit a test etc. (in this case their ‘time’ has been penalised, and so should not be followed up with a possible weekday gating). A missing or incomplete prep with mitigating circumstances, or a missed music lesson would also receive a notification. This should be inputted through ISAMs. This usually does not count towards a detention. College Conduct Alerts These are a communication device to inform tutor and Hsm where behaviour expectations have not been met. This could include chewing gum, issues with uniform, lateness etc. Accumulation of these will result in a number of interventions which could include a uniform satis, detention or gating. (Level 3) Demerits Formal acknowledgment of an issue with behaviour or missing prep. These should always be followed up in some way. Academic Demerit This results in an in-House 30 mins ‘extra prep’ (for 1), Weekday Gating (for 2) or Saturday Detention (for 3). This would be given for failure to make good on any notification received within the designated time frame. Incomplete or missing prep with no mitigating circumstances. Low yield of classwork during lesson time, (possibly owing to) poor attention or focus during a lesson (although do always consider if any SEND profile). Evident low standard of preparation for pre-warned classroom test. Input through ISAMs. Does count towards a detention. Behaviour Demerit Given for poor behaviour in class or around campus. In House the impact of this be community service (for 1), or Saturday Detention (for 2). This might be given for purposefully distracting behaviour, rudeness, stubbornness, insolence, swearing (N.B. Swearing at an adult would be dealt with at level 5 or above). Digital Demerit A digital demerit may be given for misuse of technology during lessons and/or prep sessions. (Level 4) HoD’s/HsM’s Cautions This is for more serious behaviour issues either around the campus, in lessons or in house. In almost all cases it will result in a detention as a minimum action. If a pupil picks up numerous level 2 sanctions in a week a HsM may go straight to level 4. HsM Caution For more serious matters, or persistent incidences of more minor offences, a"}

If a pupil picks up numerous level 2 sanctions in a week a HsM may go straight to level 4. HsM Caution For more serious matters, or persistent incidences of more minor offences, a Housemasters’ and Housemistresses’ (HsM’s) Caution may be issued. This will result in a meeting with HsM and may require communication home to parents. This may be given for inappropriate, aggressive, cruel or demeaning behaviour. Disregard for safety, school boundaries, missing games, bringing the school into disrepute or proactive undermining of school values. (This list is not exhaustive) The HsMs liaise closely with the Senior HsM/ DHP to ensure consistency. The action taken should be recorded in the follow up notes on ISAMs. For the more serious incidents the HsM will see the pupil and may investigate further, referring the matter to a Senior HsM or AHP if necessary. A pupil whose pastoral behaviour merits consideration at a more senior level will be referred to the Snr HsM or AHP. They will decide if the matter can be dealt with by the Senior HsM (for general concerns up to and including Assistant Head Gating - but excluding pupils in the Senior HsM’s own House) or if the pupils should come directly to the AHP’s office. The AHP deals with matters of significant bullying. HOD’s Caution This would result in a meeting with HOD. It may require a communication home to parents and is likely to result in a Saturday Detention (Brief consultation with HsM would be required prior to meeting in order to ascertain any significant/recurrent/ongoing pastoral concerns). Pupils to complete ‘Think about it memo’ for HoD or Hsm (Level 5) Senior HsM Caution Can only be issued by Senior Hsm or Senior HoD. May involve a reflective conversation, letter home, reparation meeting, detention or Senior Hsm/HoD Gating depending upon the circumstances. Could lead to support plan or behaviour contract in discussion with Heads of Upper College, Lower College or Third Form. For repeated lower-level misdemeanors (3 x detentions in a single term) or for a more significant first offence. Think About It Memo needed. A formal letter home may be sent by the Senior HsM or HoD and any “Serious Sanction” will be recorded centrally and in House records. (Level 6) Assistant Head Gating Can only be issued by a Assistant Head (or Snr HsM in the Assistant Head’s absence), often in consultation with the HsM or HoD. These are given for persistent offences or misdemeanours that are considered grave enough to be sent ‘up’ to the Deputy Head level. Think About It Memo needed. A formal letter home will be sent from the Deputy Head’s Office and this level of “Serious Sanction” and above will be recorded centrally and in House records. (Level 7) Internal Suspension This can be for up to 3 days when the pupil reports to the Assistant Head Pastoral. The pupil will not attend lessons, and will be suspended from all other school activities, although they will be given schoolwork which they will be expected to complete. (Level 8) External suspension This sanction is reserved for extremely serious breaches of school discipline that put themselves and/or others at risk of harm. The pupil will be sent home from school for a period of time determined by the Senior Deputy Head. This level of sanction is likely to incur a final warning. Impact of Sanctions and Accumulation of Demerits: Neutral sanctions (Level 1 and Level 2) will not count towards a detention (although a spate of notifications from a range of different subjects, for similar offences, may give scope for a HsM to put a student into a Weekday Gating or Saturday Detention). One Demerit results in 30 minutes ‘extra prep’ in House (although not always possible to enforce for Day Pupils and Day Boarders, in"}

One Demerit results in 30 minutes ‘extra prep’ in House (although not always possible to enforce for Day Pupils and Day Boarders, in this instance an email will be sent home to parents detailing the work that needs completing). Two Academic Demerits within a week will lead to a Tuesday afternoon Gating (Lower College) or Thursday afternoon Gating (Upper College). The count is re-set following a Gating. Three Academic Demerits within a week will lead to a Saturday Detention. The count is reset following a Detention. Two Behaviour Demerits will lead to a Saturday Detention. The count is re-set following a Detention. A pupil who has been in any Weekday Gating and gets a third Demerit that same week will be placed into the Saturday Detention as well that week. Pupils who are unable to attend a Weekday Gating will be moved to the next available Weekday Gating (Tuesday or Thursday – it would be on this occasion that Upper College and Lower College pupils may have to mix). Description of Gatings and Detentions: Weekday Gating Tuesday (Lower College) 4:45-5:30pm. Thursday (Upper College) 5:15-6:00pm. Supervised school work with laptops. No Bath Road time. Failure to attend (without mitigating circumstances) or poor behaviour during gating can be upscaled to a Saturday Detention. Saturday Detention These are an opportunity for pupils to reflect on their behaviour and consider how they can make positive changes. They will complete a Think About It Memo a reflective essay which is selected by the HsM or the person initiating the sanction. Essays should be passed to HsMs for a follow up reflection meeting with the pupil. After completing an essay pupils may get on with their own work. No laptops/tablets are allowed. Failure to attend (without mitigating circumstances) or poor behaviour during Detention can lead to an additional Weekday Gating, another Saturday Detention OR a Senior HsM Caution. Assistant Head Gating Meeting with Senior HsM or Deputy Head Academic/Assistnt Head Pastoral depending on the reason for the sanction. Letter home to parents. 08:00-17:30/18:00 - all ‘free’ time in Deputy Head’s Annex. No return to Boarding House. Supervised Lunch. Additional schoolwork required. Monitoring of Sanctions When a Level 2 sanction is inputted on ISAMs the pupil and their HsM and tutor will be alerted via email. HoDs will receive a daily report and a weekly summary of all sanctions and rewards issued on ISAMs by members of their Department. It is imperative the staff input their Department when prompted to on the system if the sanction relates to classroom or academic conduct. HoDs should therefore gain a ‘lay of the land’, identify possibly recurrent names, ensure a degree of consistency and help to guide new members of staff to the system. HsMs and Resident Tutors will receive a daily report of all sanctions and rewards issued to pupils in their relevant House. This will allow duty staff to check the pupil has understood what is required, impose the 30 minutes extra prep if needed/ possible and gain a ‘lay of the land’ for the pupils in the House. Where behavioural concerns involve a pupil with significant SEN, a disability as defined under the Equality Act 2010, or with significant and identified social, mental or emotional needs, College will make reasonable adjustments to the procedures and sanctions listed here which it considers are appropriate in relation to that individual pupil’s disability or needs. Persistent Misbehaviour If a pupil gains more than 3 detentions (academic or behaviour) in any one term it is likely they will receive an Assistant Head Gating, and a behavior contract could be in place.

Procedures a) All misbehaviour or disciplinary incidents will be dealt with as soon as it is possible to do so. b) In more serious incidents, an investigation will be carried out to establish the facts. The policies listed in the Introduction above contain procedures to be followed in specific matters. c) When a pupil is formally interviewed in relation to more serious incidents, he/she will be accompanied by his/her Tutor, HsM or other suitable member of staff to support him/her. Parents do not attend such interviews; this is to ensure that all pupils are treated in the same manner. d) In these circumstances, a pupil will always be given the opportunity to give their version of events and present any mitigating circumstances/issues. Pupils are, where relevant and possible, asked to provide a written ‘statement’ of events as soon after an incident has occurred as is practicable. e) The College staff may search a pupil or his/her possessions or accommodation in accordance with our search and confiscation policy. f) In relation to prohibited items, the Head, and staff authorised by the Head (authorised staff include the Senior Deputy Head, AHP, SDHP). Where Permanent Exclusion needs to be considered, the College will ensure that a pupil with a disability or special educational needs is able to present their case fully where their disability or special educational needs might hinder this. Any religious requirements affecting the pupil will also be considered. Individual Welfare Plans or Priority Pupil Plans will be used as necessary when making reasonable adjustments. Staff should seek advice from the Deputy Head Learning and Wellbeing or Senior Deputy Head if they are unsure about how to manage a pupil's behaviour where this is related to a special educational need or disability. every HsM), may search a pupil's possessions, without their consent, where they have reasonable grounds for suspecting that a pupil has a prohibited item in their possession. Such action will be taken in accordance with the DfE guidance Searching Screening and Confiscation (February 2014). Details may be found in the ‘Searching a Pupil’ policy, available from the Bursar's PA on request. g) If staff are required to restrain a pupil, any use of force will be reasonable, proportionate, and lawful. Reasonable force will be used in accordance with the DfE guidance Use of Reasonable Force (July 2013) and as set out in the ‘Use of Reasonable Force and restraint’ policy (available on the policy portal). A record of any physical intervention will be recorded on CPOMS and parents will be informed on the same day or as soon as is practicable. h) The College will make reasonable adjustments for managing behaviour which is related to a pupil's SEND profile. i) Being an award holder at College and wearing an award holder’s tie, carries with it the responsibility to behave in a way that reflects the influence of the position on their peers. Should any award holder’s behaviour repeatedly fall below this standard, or if there is any single event that damages the credibility of their award, then the individual’s tie may be removed temporarily or permanently. Should there be a significant breach of the terms of the award, a discussion may be had regarding the removal of any financial reward. Any scenarios where the course of action is unclear can be discussed with a senior member of staff (HOD, HsM, Senior HsM, Deputy Head). Sanctions are not carried forward from one week to the next but detentions that are not completed in a given half-term will be carried forward into"}

Should there be a significant breach of the terms of the award, a discussion may be had regarding the removal of any financial reward. Any scenarios where the course of action is unclear can be discussed with a senior member of staff (HOD, HsM, Senior HsM, Deputy Head). Sanctions are not carried forward from one week to the next but detentions that are not completed in a given half-term will be carried forward into the following half-term, except at the end of the school year. At the end of a half-term, detentions will usually be on a suitable weekday night. There is no requirement to give notice for detentions, but pupils can expect 24 hours' notice of a Saturday night detention. Corporal punishment is not used or threatened at the College and force is never used as a form of punishment. A pupil receiving a Demerit or Notification on Saturday morning may be expected to complete the work over the weekend. HsMs can check that work has been done on Sunday evening or Monday morning (depending upon Day/Boarding status). Teachers are reminded to consider the reasons for poor quality work: a Classroom Support or Notification may be more appropriate if the pupil has failed to understand a key element of the work. HsMs and tutors are asked to pay close attention to Upper College pupils who use the Academic Demerit to regularly extend work deadlines. A HoDs’ Caution may be given. Behaviour Contracts At any point where significant or persistent poor behaviour occurs in either the academic or pastoral areas of College a pupil may be placed on an agreed Behaviour Contract to enable the closer monitoring of their actions. Such a contract will be discussed with the pupil and relevant members of staff and two copies will be signed. One copy is kept in the main pupil file and the other is kept by the pupil. In the most serious cases, parents will also be sent a copy. Exclusions The College Exclusions Policy sets out the procedures to be followed in the event that a pupil may be permanently excluded. Malicious allegations against staff Where a pupil makes an accusation against a member of staff and there is reasonable suspicion that the accusation has been deliberately invented or malicious, the Head will consider whether to take disciplinary action in accordance with this policy. In accordance with the DfE's guidance Keeping Children Safe in Education (2020), the College will consider a malicious allegation to be one where there is sufficient evidence to disprove the allegation and there has been a deliberate act to deceive. Record keeping A formal sanction is recorded on the College database and forms part of the relevant pupil or pupil record. The weekly deadline is at 3pm on a Thursday, except at the end of half-terms. Formal sanctions are notified to pupils by e-mail. Review It is the responsibility of the AHP to monitor sanctions. This is done informally on a weekly basis so that patterns in behaviour can be identified and managed appropriately. Serious sanctions are reviewed termly by the AHP, and the records are signed. Sanction Levels Appendix 4 - College Rules These rules are not exhaustive but are the most important. All pupils should familiarise themselves with the main College policies which are held in Houses. 1.

Anti-Bullying (Please refer to College’s Anti-Bullying Policy) Bullying is anti-social behaviour; it is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. The College defines bullying as often repeated behaviour designed to be hurtful either physically or emotionally, where there is a power imbalance. Single incidents of targeted unkind behaviour with deliberate intent to upset or hurt would also be considered bullying. It can be between a group and an individual, or between individuals. There are five main forms of bullying. These are: • Verbal: for example, name calling, teasing, insulting, writing notes, making threats or abuse of any kind. • Physical: for example, hitting, kicking, spitting, removing belongings, and damaging property. • Psychological: taking or hiding someone’ possessions, exploiting power over someone • Emotional: for example, ostracising, tormenting, spreading rumours, gesturing. • Cyber: using any electronic communication device or social networking site to send abusive messages or display unpleasant images with the intention of upsetting a pupil or making them a figure of ridicule within the community. College will deal with all incidents of unkindness at the earliest possible opportunity. A Level 0 on our Anti-Bullying policy is used to acknowledge that young people can be unintentionally unkind at times but that this should not go unaddressed, 3. Banned Items Alcohol, cigarettes, e-cigarettes/vapes, Snus, CBD products and all illegal drugs / psychoactive substances: Chewing gum, roller blades, caffeinated energy drinks, micro scooters, laser pens, water pistols, all types of pellet guns and"}

This will then be dealt with via Hsms and Director of IT, or with the Deputy Head Pastoral as deemed appropriate. A denial of provision will impact WiFi access in all area of the College system and will cause considerable impact on day-to-day activities. Please consider what you are downloading, how much and whether this will be considered 'reasonable' by staff monitoring. Security Pupils must not disclose their passwords to anyone and must not attempt to discover or use the passwords of others. Confidentiality Any College information or records including details of pupils, parents and employees whether actual, potential or past, other than those contained in authorised and publicly available documents, must be kept confidential unless the College’s prior written consent has been obtained.

Policy Statement 2.1 Cheltenham College's Child Protection and Safeguarding Policy and Procedures (Policy) has regard to statutory guidance Keeping Children Safe in Education 2025 (KCSIE), Equality Act 2010, Working Together to Safeguard Children December 2023, Disqualification under the Childcare Act 2006 (updated 2018), and Prevent Duty Guidance for England and Wales 2023, and: 2.1.0 has been authorised by the President and Council of College; 2.1.1 is published on the Cheltenham College website and available in hard copy on request; 2.1.2 can be made available in large print or other accessible format if required; 2.1.3 its procedures apply wherever staff, Council or volunteers are working with pupils even where this is away from Cheltenham College, for example an educational visit; and 2.1.4 also applies to the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) Department. 2.2 Every pupil should feel safe and protected from any form of abuse. Cheltenham College is committed to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children and young people, particularly those who are in need or at risk. This includes providing help and support to meet the needs of children as soon as problems emerge and protecting them from maltreatment both inside and outside the home, including online. All staff and volunteers are expected to share this commitment and play an active role in identifying concerns early, responding appropriately, and maintaining a safe and supportive environment. Cheltenham College will take all reasonable measures to: 6 2.2.0 ensure that we practise safer recruitment in checking the suitability of staff, Council and volunteers (including staff employed by another organisation) to work with children and young people in accordance with: • Disqualification under the Childcare Act 2006 (updated in August 2018); • the Education (Independent School Standards) Regulations 2014; • the National Minimum Standards for Boarding Schools 2022; • the Statutory Framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage (updated 2025) See also Cheltenham College's separate Recruitment Policy 2.2.1 ensure that where staff from another organisation are working with our pupils on another site, we require written confirmation that appropriate safer recruitment checks and procedures have been completed on those staff. As made clear in our Visitor Guidance policy, external speakers are subject to vetting before any event takes place in the school; 2.2.2 follow the local inter-agency procedures of the Gloucestershire Safeguarding Children Partnership; 2.2.3 be proactive in attempting to identify pupils who may be at risk; 2.2.4 be alert to signs of abuse both in Cheltenham College and from outside and to protect each pupil from any form of abuse or harm, whether from an adult or another pupil; 2.2.5 deal appropriately with every suspicion or complaint of abuse and to support children who have been abused in accordance with his / her agreed child protection plan; 2.2.6 design and operate procedures which, so far as possible, ensure that teachers and others who are innocent are not prejudiced by false allegations;"}

Every day on rotation a member of the DSL Team is checks any alerts that come through Smoothwall. Any concerning searches are followed up with the pupil’s HsM or resident tutor, either immediately or the next day, depending on the urgency of the search. In the Prep, searches are sent to the Deputy Head (Pastoral). 2.2.16 is committed to keeping children safe online through: • Identifying and assigning roles and responsibilities to manage filtering and monitoring systems • Reviewing filtering and monitoring provision at least annually • Blocking harmful and inappropriate content without unreasonably impacting teaching and learning 2.2.17 ensure that pupils understand the need to comply with any necessary infection control measures put in place to protect themselves and others. 2.3 Keeping Children Safe in Education 2024 defines safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children as: - providing help and support to meet the needs of children as soon as problems emerge. - Protecting children from maltreatment, whether that is within or outside of the home, including online. - Preventing the impairment of children’s mental and physical health or development. - Ensuring that children grow up in circumstances consistent with the provision of safe and effective care - taking action to enable all children to have the best outcomes. 2.4 The Prevent Duty Guidance for England and Wales (2023) emphasises that the duty to have due regard to the need to prevent children from being drawn into terrorism is an aspect of safeguarding. Being drawn into terrorism includes not just violent extremism but also non-violent extremism, which can create an atmosphere conducive to terrorism and can popularise views which terrorists exploit. Schools should be safe spaces in which children and young people can understand and discuss sensitive topics, including terrorism and the extremist ideas that are part of terrorist ideology, and learn how to challenge these ideas. 2.5 Keeping Children Safe in Education 2025 provides that the inspection of independent schools will ensure that the Independent School Standards which concerns the welfare, health and safety of"}

Schools should be safe spaces in which children and young people can understand and discuss sensitive topics, including terrorism and the extremist ideas that are part of terrorist ideology, and learn how to challenge these ideas. 2.5 Keeping Children Safe in Education 2025 provides that the inspection of independent schools will ensure that the Independent School Standards which concerns the welfare, health and safety of children are met. 8 2.6 If any pupil at Cheltenham College is identified as a Looked After Child (LAC) or a Previously Looked After Child (PLAC), the DSL will work closely with the relevant Children’s Services team to ensure the pupil’s welfare is safeguarded and promoted. Where parents retain parental responsibility, we will continue to keep them informed and involved, while also ensuring that the College has full information regarding the child's care status and arrangements, including foster placements or residential care settings. The DSL will maintain direct contact with the child’s allocated social worker and will ensure the child is included on the Welfare Management Team list of vulnerable pupils, with regular discussion at DSL safeguarding meetings. The DSL will also liaise with the Virtual School Head (VSH) for the relevant local authority. The VSH has responsibility for promoting the educational outcomes of all children in care and supporting previously looked after children. The DSL will ensure that the Personal Education Plan (PEP) is in place and up to date, and that any additional support recommended by the VSH is actioned appropriately. 2.7 At Cheltenham College, staff are expected to be proactive in identifying pupils who may benefit from early help. This means providing support as soon as a concern arises, whether in the Early Years Foundation Stage or through to Upper College. Staff should raise concerns with the Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL), who will coordinate appropriate support and liaise with external agencies where necessary. Staff may be involved in early help assessments, including identifying emerging issues, sharing relevant information, and in some cases, acting as the lead professional. Cheltenham College staff should be particularly alert to pupils who are frequently missing from education, have experienced multiple suspensions, are at risk of permanent exclusion, or are affected by parental imprisonment or offending. Other indicators may include involvement in anti-social or criminal behaviour, risk of exploitation or radicalisation, low attendance, or early signs of abuse or neglect. Early identification and intervention are central to the College’s safeguarding approach and commitment to pupil wellbeing. Our Early help procedures are outlined in our Early Help Policy. 2.8 Children with special educational needs (SEN) and disabilities can face additional safeguarding challenges. Staff must: • Be wary of making assumptions that indicators of possible abuse such as behaviour, mood and injury relate to the child’s disability without further exploration; • Be aware that children with SEN and disabilities can be disproportionally impacted by things like bullying - without outwardly showing any signs; and • Be aware of communication barriers and difficulties in overcoming these barriers • Consider that some children are more prone to peer group isolation than other children 2.9 Staff should be sensitive to the needs of gender questioning pupils, who should be considered as potentially vulnerable 2.10 Staff should also be aware that international children can be additionally vulnerable and therefore face safeguarding challenges. 3. The Designated Safeguarding Lead 3.1 Cheltenham College's Council has appointed a member of staff with the necessary status and authority (Designated Safeguarding Lead) to be responsible for matters relating to child protection and welfare. 9 3.2 The Designated Safeguarding Lead shall be given the time, funding, training, resources and support to enable him/her to support other staff on safeguarding matters, to contribute to strategy discussions and/or inter-agency meetings and to contribute to the assessment of children. 3.3 Parents are welcome to approach the Designated Safeguarding Lead if they have any concerns about the welfare of any child in Cheltenham College.

Anybody can make a referral. If the child's situation does not appear to be improving the staff member with concerns should press for re-consideration through the GSCP escalation policy. 5.2 Action by the Designated Safeguarding Lead 5.2.0 On being notified of a complaint or suspicion of abuse, the action to be taken by the Designated Safeguarding Lead will take into account: (a) the local inter-agency procedures of the Gloucestershire Safeguarding Children Partnership; 12 (b) where relevant, local information sharing protocols relating to Channel referrals; (c) the nature and seriousness of the suspicion or complaint. A complaint involving a serious criminal offence, including the identification of someone who may already be engaged in illegal terrorist-related activity, will always be referred to children's social care and, if appropriate, the police; (d) the child's wishes or feelings; and (e) duties of confidentiality, so far as applicable. 5.2.1 The Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL) will follow Gloucestershire’s Graduated Pathway of Early Help and Support to assess concerns relating to a child’s safety, and potential risk of harm. (a) Early Help will be contacted when emerging concerns about a child or family are identified that do not meet the threshold for immediate statutory intervention but indicate that additional support is needed to improve outcomes. This may include concerns around emotional wellbeing, behaviour, attendance, parenting capacity, or the impact of parental issues such as mental health, substance misuse, or domestic abuse. Early help coordinators can be contacted for advice without the need to share personal data. (b) The Designated Safeguarding Lead (or DDSL) will contact the Community Social Worker when there are emerging concerns about a child’s welfare that require professional advice but do not yet meet the threshold for a referral to the Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH). This includes situations where the DSL is unsure about the level of risk and needs guidance on next steps, or require help in identifying suitable support services for a family. Sharing relevant personal information with the Community Social Worker is necessary to enable informed advice and decision-making in the best interests of the child. (c) A referral to the Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH) will be made when there is a concern that a child is at risk of significant harm or in need of statutory support. This includes situations where there is reasonable cause to suspect a child is suffering, or likely to suffer, significant harm, requiring a Section 47 enquiry under the Children Act 1989. A referral will also be made under Section 17 of the Act when a child is identified as being in need of additional services to achieve or maintain a reasonable standard of health or development, or to prevent significant impairment. The Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL) is responsible for making timely referrals to MASH, ensuring that sufficient information is provided to allow for a thorough multi-agency assessment and decision-making process. Where appropriate, consent from parents or carers will be sought prior to the referral; however, this will be overridden if doing so would place the child at greater risk. 13 5.2.2 Referrals to the MASH are submitted using the Multi-Agency Referral Form (MARF), which must be completed in full with relevant information about the child, the concerns, and any actions already taken. The MARF can be accessed and submitted through the Gloucestershire County Council's online portal: https://forms.gloucestershire.gov.uk/xfp/form/429. In urgent cases, the DSL (or DDSL) will contact the Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH) by telephone on 01452 426565 (Option 3) to ensure a timely response. Where a child is at immediate risk of harm, the DSL will call 999 and take any necessary steps to protect the child without delay. 5.2.3 The Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL) will respond to concerns that a child may be vulnerable to radicalisation"}

In cases where advice is needed or concerns meet safeguarding thresholds, the DSL may also contact the Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH) on 01452 426565 (Option 3). 5.3 Dealing with allegations against staff (including the DSL), Council volunteers and contractors 5.3.0 Cheltenham College has procedures for dealing with allegations against staff, Council volunteers and contractors who work with children that aim to strike a balance between the need to protect children from abuse and the need to protect staff, contractors and volunteers from false or unfounded allegations. These procedures are set out in Appendix 4 and follow Part 4 of KCSIE. 5.3.1 The local authority has designated a particular officer, or team of officers, to be involved in the management and oversight of allegations against people that work with children (Designated Officer(s)). The designated officer(s) will be informed immediately and in any event within one working day of all allegations against staff, Council, volunteers and contractors that come to Cheltenham College's attention and appear to meet the criteria set out in paragraph 1 of Appendix 4. 5.3.2 Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) (a) Cheltenham College will inform Ofsted of any allegations of serious harm or abuse by any person living, working or looking after children on the premises of 14 the EYFS Department (whether that allegation relates to harm or abuse committed on the premises or elsewhere), and will provide details of the action taken in respect of those allegations. (b) These notifications will be made as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within 14 days of the allegations being made. 5.3.3 Detailed guidance is given to staff, and volunteers to ensure that their behaviour and actions do not place pupils or themselves at risk of harm or of allegations of harm to a pupil. This guidance is contained in the Staff Code of Conduct, which is available on request, and includes detail of additional safeguarding arrangements where staff engage in one-to-one teaching and meetings with pupils. Contractors are provided with clear guidance in a separate document. 5.3.4 Staff and volunteers should also feel able to follow Cheltenham College's separate Whistleblowing Policy to raise concerns about poor or unsafe safeguarding practices at Cheltenham College, potential failures by Cheltenham College or its staff to properly safeguard the welfare of pupils or other wrongdoing in the workplace that does not involve the safeguarding and welfare of children. 5.4 Allegations against pupils 5.4.0 All staff must be aware that abuse is abuse and it should never be tolerated or passed off as ‘banter’ or part of the growing up process. Allegations against pupils that may meet Level 3 or 4 on the Levels of Intervention Windscreen should be reported in accordance with the procedures set out in this Policy. A pupil against whom an allegation of abuse has been made may be suspended from Cheltenham College during the investigation and Cheltenham College's policy on behaviour, discipline and sanctions will apply. 5.4.1 Cheltenham College will take advice from children's social care on the investigation of such allegations and will take all appropriate action to ensure the safety and welfare of all pupils involved including the pupil or pupils accused of abuse. 5.4.2 If it is necessary for a pupil to be interviewed by the police in relation to allegations of abuse, Cheltenham College will ensure that, subject to the advice of children's"}

In the case of pupils whose parents are abroad, the pupil's Education Guardian will be requested to provide support to the pupil and to accommodate him / her if it is necessary to suspend him / her during the investigation. 5.4.3 Where an allegation is made against a pupil, both the victim and the perpetrator will be treated as being at risk and safeguarding procedures in accordance with this Policy will be followed and risk assessments will be put in place for both where appropriate 5.5 Organisations or individuals using school premises. All staff should be aware that Cheltenham College may receive an allegation relating to an incident that happened when an individual or organisation was using the school premises for the purposes of running activities for children e.g. sports clubs, community groups, services providers that run extra-curricular activities, international language schools etc. As with any safeguarding allegation, the procedures in Appendix 4 of this policy should be followed, which will include the LADO being informed. 15 5.6 Missing child and children missing from education procedures Missing and absent Children Cheltenham College recognises the importance of excellent attendance in school to facilitate the best educational outcomes for every pupil as set out in Working Together to Improve Attendance (2024). To quote from the Attendance and Registration Policy of both College and Prep, “We aim for an environment that enables and encourages all members of the community to reach out for excellence. To do this, it is essential that every child attends Prep / College every day and on time.” KCSIE 2025 states that children who are absent from education for prolonged periods and / or on repeat occasions can act as a vital warning sign to a range of safeguarding issues including neglect, child sexual and criminal exploitation, particularly county lines. All staff should therefore be very vigilant in terms of monitoring and reporting any concerns around pupil absence to the DSL team. Please see Cheltenham College’s separate policy on attendance and registration. 5.6.0 All staff are informed of the separate procedure to be used for searching for, and if necessary, reporting, any pupil missing from Cheltenham College. The procedure includes the requirement to record any incident, the action taken and the reasons given by the pupil for being missing. 5.6.1 Please see Cheltenham College's separate Missing Pupil Policy for further details. Children Missing from Education In accordance with the School Attendance (Pupil Registration) (England) Regulations 2024, Cheltenham College recognises its legal duty to inform the local authority of new pupils added to the admissions register at non-standard transition points. This is to help the local authority in identifying and safeguarding children who may be at risk of becoming missing from education. The College will notify the local authority by emailing school.admissions@gloucestershire.gov.uk within five school days when a pupil is added to the admissions register outside of the school’s standard points of entry. Children Missing Education (CME) are children of compulsory school age who are not registered pupils at a school and are not receiving suitable education otherwise than at a school 5.6.2 Cheltenham College will notify Gloucestershire County Council (or the pupil’s home local authority) within five school days of removing a pupil from the admissions register where the removal meets any of the circumstances set out in Regulation 9, including: (i) The pupil is being electively home educated (ii) The pupil has moved to another school (iii) The pupil is no longer living within a reasonable"}

This will be done within 5 days of the student joining in order to: (a) fulfil its duty to identify children of compulsory school age who are missing education; and (b) follow up with any child who might be in danger of not receiving an education and who might be at risk of abuse or neglect. 5.6.4 Cheltenham College shall inform the local authority of any pupil who has been absent without Cheltenham College’s permission for a continuous period of 10 school days or more; has not taken up an allocated school place as expected or has left school suddenly and the destination is unknown. 5.7 Informing parents 5.7.0 Parents will normally be kept informed as appropriate of any action to be taken under these procedures. However, there may be circumstances when the Designated Safeguarding Lead will need to consult the Head, the designated officer, children's social care and/or the police before discussing details with parents. 5.7.1 In relation to Prevent referrals, the Designated Safeguarding Lead will consider seeking the consent of the pupil (or their parent/guardian) when determining what information can be shared. Whether or not consent is sought will be dependent on the circumstances of the case but may relate to issues such as the health of the individual, law enforcement or protection of the public. 5.7.2 See also section 3 of Appendix 4 for details about the disclosure of information where an allegation has been made against a member of staff, volunteer or the Head of Cheltenham College. 6. Secure College premises 6.1 Cheltenham College will take all practicable steps to ensure that College premises are as secure as circumstances permit. 6.2 Cheltenham College keeps a visitors’ record at Reception. All visitors must sign in on arrival and sign out on departure and are escorted whilst on College premises by a member of staff or appropriately vetted volunteer. All visitors will be given a name badge which must be clearly displayed and worn at all times whilst on Cheltenham College premises. 6.3 All visitors to the boarding houses must report to a member of staff immediately on arrival and must observe the necessity to be kept under sufficient staff supervision during their visit. 6.4 Cheltenham College's policy on the use of mobile phones and cameras in Cheltenham College, including the EYFS setting, is set out in the Staff ICT Acceptable Usage Policy. This policy applies to all staff in College, Prep and Pre-Prep. In the EYFS setting, neither staff nor children are permitted to bring mobile phones or any electronic device with imaging and sharing capabilities into the area. 17 Pupils in College may not carry mobile phones with them during the school day, except for those in Upper College. For those pupils, mobile phones should only be used with the express permission of a member of staff. Boarders in Third – Lower Sixth Form will be required to hand in their phones over night to ensure pupils cannot use 4G, or 5G networks. Pupils in Upper College are allowed to keep phones with them, but they will be removed if house staff"}

Pupils in Cheltenham Prep are not allowed to have mobile phones with them during the day, and boarders may only access them at specific times 6.5 Parents may bring mobile phones onto the premises but may only take photographs during events such as plays, concerts or sporting events for personal use. Parents should be reminded that the publications of such images (including on personal social networking sites even where access to the image may be limited) may be unlawful. 7. Confidentiality and information sharing 7.1 Cheltenham College will keep all child protection records confidential, allowing disclosure only to those who need the information in order to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. The College will co-operate with police and children's social care to ensure that all relevant information is shared for the purposes of child protection investigations under section 47 of the Children Act 1989 in accordance with the requirements of Working Together to Safeguard Children (2023) Prevent Duty Guidance for England and Wales (2023) and Channel Duty Guidance: Protecting People Susceptible to Radicalisation (2025), 7.2 Where allegations have been made against staff, Cheltenham College will consult with the LADO and, where appropriate, the police and children's social care to agree the information that should be disclosed and to whom. 8. Monitoring and review 8.1 The Designated Safeguarding Lead will ensure that the procedures set out in this policy and the implementation of these procedures are updated and reviewed regularly, working with Council as necessary. The Designated Safeguarding Leads will update their respective Senior Leadership Teams at least once per term on the operation of Cheltenham College's safeguarding arrangements. Any child protection incidents or near misses at Cheltenham College may be followed by a review of these procedures by one of the Designated Safeguarding Leads and the Council Nominated Member. A report will be made to Council Welfare and Safeguarding Committee. Any of the DSL team, the Head or the Council Nominated Member may instigate a review. Where an incident involves a member of staff, the LADO will assist in this review to determine whether any improvements can be made to Cheltenham College's procedures. Any deficiencies or weaknesses regarding child protection arrangements will be remedied without delay. The DSL teams will review cases on a termly basis to ensure any lessons from cases in that term can be learnt quickly. In addition, the Designated Safeguarding Lead will undertake an annual review of this Policy and Cheltenham College's safeguarding procedures, including the effectiveness of inter-agency working. The outcome of this annual review will be reported to Cheltenham College Council. Cheltenham College Council will review this Policy and the implementation of its procedures and consider the proposed amendments to the Policy, from both the Designated Safeguarding Lead and its own members, before giving the revised Policy its final approval. Detailed minutes recording the review by Cheltenham College Council will be made. 18 Appendix 1: The role of the Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL) and Deputy Designated Safeguarding Lead (DDSL) At Cheltenham College the DSL is a senior member of staff from the school or college leadership team, is appointed to the role of designated safeguarding lead.

Where children leave the school or college (including in year transfers) the designated safeguarding lead will ensure their child protection file is transferred to the new school or college as soon as possible and that the LA is informed. Raising Awareness The designated safeguarding lead will: • ensure each member of staff has access to, and understands, the school’s or college’s child protection policy and procedures, especially new and part-time staff • ensure the school’s or college’s child protection policy is reviewed annually (as a minimum) and the procedures and implementation are updated and reviewed regularly, and work with governing bodies or proprietors regarding this • ensure the child protection policy is available publicly and parents know that referrals about suspected abuse or neglect may be made and the role of the school or college in this • link with the safeguarding partner arrangements to make sure staff are aware of any training opportunities and the latest local policies on local safeguarding arrangements, and • help promote educational outcomes by sharing the information about the welfare, safeguarding and child protection issues that children who have or have had a social worker are experiencing with teachers and school and college leadership staff. Training, knowledge and skills The designated safeguarding lead (and any deputies) will undergo training to provide them with the knowledge and skills required to carry out the role and ensure that this is updated at least every two years. The designated safeguarding lead (and any deputies) will undertake Prevent awareness training. This training will provide DSLs and DDSLs with a good understanding of their own role, how to identify, understand and respond to specific needs that can increase the vulnerability of children, as well as specific harms that can put children at risk, and the 20 processes, procedures and responsibilities of other agencies, particularly local authority children’s social care, so they: • understand the assessment process for providing early help and statutory intervention, including local criteria for action and local authority children’s social care referral arrangements • have a working knowledge of how local authorities conduct a child protection case conference and a child protection review conference and be able to attend and contribute to these effectively when required to do so • understand the importance of the role the designated safeguarding lead has in providing information and support to local authority children social care in order to safeguard and promote the welfare of children • understand the lasting impact that adversity and trauma can have, including on children’s behaviour, mental health and wellbeing, and what is needed in responding to this in promoting educational outcomes • are alert to the specific needs of children in need, those with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), those with relevant health conditions and young carers • understand the importance of information sharing, both within the school and college, and with the safeguarding partners, other agencies, organisations and practitioners • understand and support the school or college with regards to the requirements of the Prevent duty and are able to provide advice and support to staff on protecting children from the risk of radicalisation • are able to understand the unique risks associated with online safety and be confident that they have the relevant knowledge and up to date capability required to keep children safe whilst they are online at school or college and have an excellent understanding of the filtering and monitoring systems in place at school, including school devices • can recognise the additional risks that children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) face online, for example, from bullying, grooming and"}

Providing support to staff Training will support the DSL and DDSL in developing expertise, so they can support and advise staff and help them feel confident on welfare, safeguarding and child protection matters. This includes specifically to: • ensure that staff are supported during the referrals processes, and • support staff to consider how safeguarding, welfare and educational outcomes are linked, including to inform the provision of academic and pastoral support. Understanding the views of children It is important that all children feel heard and understood. Therefore, designated safeguarding leads (and deputies) will be supported in developing knowledge and skills to: • encourage a culture of listening to children and taking account of their wishes and feelings, among all staff, and in any measures the school or college may put in place to protect them, and, 21 • understand the difficulties that children may have in approaching staff about their circumstances and consider how to build trusted relationships which facilitate communication. Holding and sharing information The critical importance of recording, holding, using and sharing information effectively is set out in Parts one, two and five of KCSIE, and therefore the designated safeguarding lead will be equipped to: • understand the importance of information sharing, both within the school and college, and with other schools and colleges on transfer including in-year and between primary and secondary education, and with the safeguarding partners, other agencies, organisations and practitioners • understand relevant data protection legislation and regulations, especially the Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), and • be able to keep detailed, accurate, secure written records of concerns and referrals and understand the purpose of this record-keeping. The Deputy Designated Safeguarding Lead will carry out all aspects of this role where the Designated Safeguarding Lead is unavailable. 22 Appendix 2: Types and signs of abuse Staff should be aware that abuse, neglect and exploitation are rarely standalone events that can be covered by one definition or label. In most cases multiple issues will overlap with one another. It is important that all staff are clear that abuse can take place wholly online or technology may be used to facilitate offline abuse. Children may be vulnerable to multiple harms including (but not limited to) sexual exploitation, criminal exploitation, and serious youth violence. Staff can use this Government advice on ‘What to do if you are worried a child is being abused’. 1 Types of abuse, neglect and exploitation. 1.1 Abuse, neglect and exploitation is a form of maltreatment of a child. Somebody may abuse or neglect a child by inflicting harm, or by failing to act to prevent harm. Children may be abused in a family or in an institutional or community setting by those known to them or, more rarely, by others (e.g. via the internet). They may be abused by an adult or adults or another child or children. Children may also be the target of exploitation. Part one of KCSIE defines the following types of abuse. 1.2 Child on child abuse: KCSIE states ‘Governing bodies and proprietors should ensure their Child Protection Policy includes procedures to minimise the risk of child-on-child abuse and sets out how allegations of such abuse"}

Children may be abused in a family or in an institutional or community setting by those known to them or, more rarely, by others (e.g. via the internet). They may be abused by an adult or adults or another child or children. Children may also be the target of exploitation. Part one of KCSIE defines the following types of abuse. 1.2 Child on child abuse: KCSIE states ‘Governing bodies and proprietors should ensure their Child Protection Policy includes procedures to minimise the risk of child-on-child abuse and sets out how allegations of such abuse will be investigated’ The document also states the importance of keeping the ‘voice of the child’ at the heart of decision making and in determining what procedures to follow. Cheltenham College has its own standalone Child on Child Abuse policy and the guidance therein must be followed. The purpose of the guidance contained within the policy is to recognise the many forms of child-on-child abuse and to include a planned and supportive response to issues that might arise in accordance with KCSIE 2025 and Working Together to Safeguarding Children 2023. All such abuse is unacceptable and will be taken seriously. Cheltenham College will also be mindful of the Statutory Guidance on Controlling or Coercive Behaviour to identify and evidence any potential offences. Cheltenham College is clear that abuse is abuse. Abuse should never be tolerated or passed off as ‘banter’ or ‘just having a laugh’ or ‘part of the growing up process’. Examples of child-on-child abuse: There are many types of abuse and the list is not exhaustive. • Physical abuse • Sexually harmful behaviour/including sexual assault • Bullying (including cyber-bullying and prejudiced behaviour) • Sexting/Sextortion • Teenage relationship abuse (coercion, controlling behaviour, sexual harassment, threats insults and/or acts of physical or sexual abuse) 23 • Initiation / hazing rituals • Emotional abuse (deliberate taunting or exclusion) Cheltenham College must strive to adopt a zero tolerance culture towards abusive behaviour. As well as participating in annual whole staff training, staff should: • Model (model good behaviours of courtesy and respect) • Challenge (challenge behaviours that fall short) • Correct (Make it clear why that behaviour is wrong) • Protect (ensure that the child or young person subjected to the abuse is safe/alright – don’t just assume.) • Report (If necessary, report the behaviour to the HsM / Head of Section or if of significant concern, follow advice in this guidance and contact a member of the DSL team.) 1.3 Physical abuse: a form of abuse which may involve hitting, shaking, throwing, poisoning, burning or scalding, drowning, suffocating or otherwise causing physical harm to a child. Physical harm may also be caused when a parent or carer fabricates the symptoms of, or deliberately induces, illness in a child. 1.4 Emotional abuse: the persistent emotional maltreatment of a child such as to cause severe and adverse effects on the child’s emotional development. It may involve conveying to a child that they are worthless or unloved, inadequate, or valued only insofar as they meet the needs of another person. It may include not giving the child opportunities to express their views, deliberately silencing them or ‘making fun’ of what they say or how they communicate. It may feature age or developmentally inappropriate expectations being imposed on children. These may include interactions that are beyond a child’s developmental capability as well as overprotection and limitation of exploration and learning, or preventing the child participating in normal social interaction. It may involve seeing or hearing the ill-treatment of another. It may involve serious bullying (including cyberbullying), causing children frequently to feel frightened or in danger, or the exploitation or corruption of children. Some level of emotional abuse is involved in all types of maltreatment of a child, although it may occur alone. 1.5 Sexual abuse: involves forcing or enticing a child or young person to take part in sexual activities, not necessarily involving a high level of violence, whether or not the child is aware of what is happening. The activities may involve physical contact, including assault by penetration (for example rape or oral sex) or non-penetrative acts such as masturbation, kissing, rubbing and touching"}

Some level of emotional abuse is involved in all types of maltreatment of a child, although it may occur alone. 1.5 Sexual abuse: involves forcing or enticing a child or young person to take part in sexual activities, not necessarily involving a high level of violence, whether or not the child is aware of what is happening. The activities may involve physical contact, including assault by penetration (for example rape or oral sex) or non-penetrative acts such as masturbation, kissing, rubbing and touching outside of clothing. They may also include non-contact activities, such as up skirting*, involving children in looking at, or in the production of, sexual images, watching sexual activities, encouraging children to behave in sexually inappropriate ways, or grooming a child in preparation for abuse (including via the internet). Sexual abuse is not solely perpetrated by adult males. Women can also commit acts of sexual abuse, as can other children. Part 5 of KCSIE 2025 contains useful guidance on how to deal with any allegations of sexual abuse. Up skirting, downblousing and cyber flashing are all criminal offences. 24 Up skirting typically involves taking a picture under a person’s clothing without them knowing, with the intention of viewing their genitals or buttocks to obtain sexual gratification, or cause the victim humiliation, distress or alarm. Downblousing is the act of taking a photograph or image down somebody's shirt, blouse or top without their consent with intention of obtaining sexual gratification, or to cause humiliation, distress or alarm. Cyber-flashing is a form of digital harassment or sexual misconduct. It involves sending unsolicited explicit images or videos of genitalia or other intimate body parts to another person via electronic means, such as text messages, emails, or through social media platforms. 1.6 Neglect: the persistent failure to meet a child’s basic physical and/or psychological needs, likely to result in the serious impairment of the child’s health or development. Neglect may occur during pregnancy as a result of maternal substance abuse. Once a child is born, neglect may involve a parent or carer failing to: provide adequate food, clothing and shelter (including exclusion from home or abandonment); protect a child from physical and emotional harm or danger; ensure adequate supervision (including the use of inadequate care-givers); or ensure access to appropriate medical care or treatment. It may also include neglect of, or unresponsiveness to, a child’s basic emotional needs. 1.7 KCSIE acknowledges the following as specific safeguarding issues: 1.7.1 children missing from education 1.7.2 Unexplainable and/or persistent absences from education 1.7.3 children missing from home or care 1.7.4 bullying including cyberbullying 1.7.5 Witnessing the ill-treatment of others (including all forms of domestic abuse where children see, hear or experience its effects) 1.7.6 drugs 1.7.7 fabricated or induced illness 1.7.8 faith abuse 1.7.9 forced marriage 1.7.10 gangs and youth violence 1.7.11 gender-based violence/violence against women and girls 1.7.12 mental health 1.7.13 private fostering 1.7.14 preventing radicalisation (see section 3 below) 25 1.7.15 Sharing of nudes and semi-nudes 1.7.16 teenage relationship abuse 1.7.17 Trafficking 1.7.18 County Lines Annex B of KCSIE lists the following as additional examples of specific harms: • Child abduction and community safety incidents • Child Criminal Exploitation (CCE) and Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) • Children and the court system • Children with family members in prison • Cybercrime • Homelessness • Modern Slavery • Sexual violence and sexual harassment between children in schools • Serious Violence • So-called ‘honour’-based abuse, including Female Genital Mutilation and Forced Marriage Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) and Child Criminal Exploitation (CCE): Both CSE and CCE are forms of abuse and both occur where an individual or group takes advantage of an imbalance in power to coerce, manipulate or deceive a child into sexual or criminal activity. Whilst age may be the most obvious, this power imbalance can also be due to a range of other factors including gender, sexual identity, cognitive ability, physical strength, status, and access to economic or other resources. In some cases, the abuse will be in exchange for something the victim needs or wants and/or will be to the financial benefit or other advantage (such"}

Whilst age may be the most obvious, this power imbalance can also be due to a range of other factors including gender, sexual identity, cognitive ability, physical strength, status, and access to economic or other resources. In some cases, the abuse will be in exchange for something the victim needs or wants and/or will be to the financial benefit or other advantage (such as increased status) of the perpetrator or facilitator. The abuse can be perpetrated by individuals or groups, males or females, and children or adults. The abuse can be a one-off occurrence or a series of incidents over timeand range from opportunistic to complex organised abuse. It can involve force and/or enticement-based methods of compliance and may, or may not, be accompanied by violence or threats of violence. Victims can be exploited even when activity appears consensual and it should be noted exploitation as well as being physical can be facilitated and/or take place online CSE can involve exploitative situations, contexts and relationships where young people receive something (for example food, accommodation, drugs, alcohol, gifts, money or in some cases simply affection) as a result of engaging in sexual activities. Sexual exploitation can take many forms ranging from the seemingly ‘consensual’ relationship where sex is exchanged for affection or gifts, to serious organised crime by gangs and groups. What marks out exploitation is an imbalance of power in the relationship. The perpetrator always holds some kind of power over the victim which increases as the exploitative relationship develops. Sexual exploitation involves varying degrees of coercion, intimidation or enticement, including unwanted pressure from peers to have sex, sexual bullying including 26 cyberbullying and grooming. However, it also important to recognise that some young people who are being sexually exploited do not exhibit any external signs of this abuse. Female genital mutilation: Professionals in all agencies, and individuals and groups in relevant communities, need to be alert to the possibility of a girl being at risk of FGM, or already having suffered FGM. There is a range of potential indicators that a child or young person may be at risk of FGM, which individually may not indicate risk but if there are two or more indicators present this could signal a risk to the child or young person. Victims of FGM are likely to come from a community that is known to practise FGM. Professionals should note that girls at risk of FGM may not yet be aware of the practice or that it may be conducted on them, so sensitivity should always be shown when approaching the subject. Warning signs that FGM may be about to take place, or may have already taken place, can be found on pages 16-17 of the Multi-Agency Practice Guidelines on Female Genital Mutilation. Staff should activate local safeguarding procedures, using existing national and local protocols for multi-agency liaison with police and children’s social care. From 31 October 2015 it is mandatory for any instances of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) to be reported to the police. FGM is illegal under the FGM Act 2003, and comprises of all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia for non-medical reasons. College follows the FGM Guidance for Schools (June 2019) • If a girl informs a member of staff that an act of FGM (however described) has been carried out on her, or where the member of staff observes physical signs on a girl appearing to show that an act of FGM has been carried out and the person has no reason to believe that the act was, or was part of, a surgical operation, then the police should be informed as soon as possible, at least by the end of the next working day. • Gloucestershire Police should be informed by calling 101. • If there is a risk to life or serious immediate harm, staff should report the case immediately to police, including dialling 999 if appropriate. • Please ensure you are given a"}

As with all Child Protection issues no leading questions should be asked, and a record of the conversation should be made as soon as possible. The DSL should be informed as soon as possible, but they would not make the report to the police. If a girl informs a member of staff that an act of FGM has been committed to them they must not perform any examination to ascertain the validity of this statement. Any checks must be done by medical professionals. The duty to report a disclosure to the police is a personal duty and cannot be transferred, unless you know that Cheltenham College has already made report about the same instance. If the girl is 18 or over at the time of the disclosure staff do not need to disclose to the police but it should be reported to the DSL. The duty applies to cases directly disclosed by the victim; if a parent, guardian, sibling or other individual discloses that a girl under 18 has had FGM, the duty does not apply and a report to the police is not mandatory. Any such disclosure should be reported to the DSL. 27 The DSL should inform the girl’s parents / guardian that the disclosure has been made and that a report will be/has gone to the police. However, if the DSL and the member of staff whom the disclosure was made to believe that telling the child or parents or guardian about the report may result in a risk of serious harm to the child or anyone else, or of the family fleeing the country, it should not be discussed with the family. The protection of the child must be paramount at all times. Staff should continue have regard to their wider safeguarding responsibilities once the report has been made. Failure to comply with this duty to report FGM will be dealt with in line with the staff disciplinary procedures and for teachers this may mean referral to the TRA (Teaching Regulation Agency). It is important to note that if a member of staff has suspicions that FGM has been carried out, or that a girl may be at risk of FGM this should be reported to the DSL immediately who will contact the GSCP. ‘Up skirting’ The Voyeurism (Offences) Act 2019 criminalises the act of 'up skirting'. The Criminal Prosecution Service (CPS) defines 'up skirting' as a colloquial term referring to the action of placing equipment such as a camera or mobile phone beneath a person’s clothing to take a voyeuristic photograph without their permission. It is not only confined to victims wearing skirts or dresses and equally applies when men or women are wearing kilts, cassocks, shorts or trousers. It is often performed in crowded public places, for example on public transport or at music festivals, which can make it difficult to notice offenders. If a member of staff becomes aware of any incident of this nature taking place by or to a College pupil they should contact the DSL or DSL team as soon as possible. Relationship and Sex Education (RSE) The RSE curriculum follows the DfE's Relationship and Sex Education Guidance for schools. Curriculum content supports safeguarding by helping pupils to develop an understanding of how to live safe and healthy lives, respecting themselves and others and recognising healthy and unhealthy relationships. Staff should be aware of any potential issues which may come out of such lessons, and should report any concerns to the DSL team through CPOMS as soon as possible. Mental Health"}

Staff should be aware of any potential issues which may come out of such lessons, and should report any concerns to the DSL team through CPOMS as soon as possible. Mental Health Issues All staff should also be aware that mental health problems can, in some cases, be an indicator that a child has suffered or is at risk of suffering abuse, neglect or exploitation. Only appropriately trained professionals should attempt to make a diagnosis of a mental health problem. Staff however, are well placed to observe children day-to-day and identify those whose behaviour suggests that they may be experiencing a mental health problem or be at risk of developing one. Where children have suffered abuse and neglect, or other potentially traumatic adverse childhood experiences, this can have a lasting impact throughout childhood, adolescence and into adulthood. It is key that staff are aware of how these children’s experiences, can impact on their mental health, behaviour and education. 28 If staff have a mental health concern about a child that is also a safeguarding concern, immediate action should be taken, by speaking to the designated safeguarding lead or a deputy. If in any doubt staff in College should speak to the Assistant Head (Safeguarding & Pupil Welfare) about any pupil mental health concerns they have and these should be recorded on CPOMS. Online Safety: The Four Cs and Emerging Risks Cheltenham College recognises the breadth and complexity of safeguarding risks that children and young people may face online. These risks are categorised under the “Four Cs”: 1. Content – being exposed to harmful or inappropriate material (e.g. pornography, self-harm material, hate speech, misinformation and disinformation) 2. Contact – being subjected to harmful interaction with others online (e.g. grooming, online bullying or exploitation) 3. Conduct – engaging in risky or harmful online behaviour themselves (e.g. sexting, oversharing, or radicalisation) 4. Commerce – being exposed to harmful commercial practices (e.g. gambling, scams, and financial exploitation) The school recognises the evolving nature of online risks and is committed to safeguarding pupils from digital harms in all forms. This includes risks associated with generative artificial intelligence (AI), misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Generative AI technologies (such as chatbots, text generators, and image creation tools) will only be used in an age-appropriate, supervised context to support learning objectives. All use must comply with the school’s Acceptable Use Policy and data protection requirements. Staff and pupils must not enter personal, sensitive, or identifying information into AI tools. Risks, including exposure to harmful or biased content, misinformation, and discriminatory material, are actively managed. The school’s internet filtering and monitoring systems, restrict access to unsafe AI platforms and flag concerning activity. Staff receive regular training on the safe and ethical use of AI, and pupils are taught skills to critically evaluate AI-generated content. Misinformation, Disinformation, and Conspiracy Theories The school recognises that misinformation (inaccurate or misleading information shared without intent to deceive), disinformation (false or manipulated content shared with deliberate intent to deceive, such as “fake news”), and conspiracy theories can present significant safeguarding risks. Such harms can undermine trust in adults, schools, and safeguarding systems; radicalise or socially isolate pupils; contribute to poor mental health and anxiety; and negatively affect behaviour, critical thinking, and academic engagement. Through our online safety curriculum and pastoral care systems, we provide pupils with strategies to recognise and challenge harmful narratives, access safe and reliable information sources, and develop resilience to online manipulation. Filtering and monitoring tools are configured to detect and address related risks, and staff are trained to identify early warning signs and respond appropriately. 29 Teaching Online Safety Cheltenham College recognises the critical importance of equipping pupils with the knowledge, skills, and resilience to navigate the digital world safely and responsibly. To this end, the College ensures"}

To this end, the College ensures that key components of online safety are thoroughly embedded across the curriculum, beginning in the early years and continuing throughout a pupil’s time at the school. At Cheltenham Prep, online safety education is delivered through a cross-curricular approach, with specific content integrated into the Thrive program and Computing curriculum. These lessons are age-appropriate and regularly reviewed to reflect emerging risks and technologies, such as social media platforms, gaming, data privacy, and online scams. At College focused online safety content is delivered through the FLOREAT program. Lessons explore issues such as digital footprint, cyberbullying, sextortion, online grooming, misinformation/disinformation, and the risks associated with AI-driven manipulation. The development and delivery of these materials are informed by the Department for Education’s “Teaching Online Safety in Schools” guidance, which outlines what children should know to stay safe and behave appropriately online. Staff use this document to ensure content is not only relevant and evidence-based but also tailored to pupils' developmental stages and digital habits. In addition, online safety is reinforced through: • Assemblies and special focus days such as Safer Internet Day • Regular communication with parents and guardians to support safe use of technology at home • INSET and CPD for staff to ensure awareness of the latest digital safeguarding risks This multi-layered approach helps pupils develop critical thinking, digital awareness, and the confidence to speak up if something online makes them feel uncomfortable or unsafe. 2 Signs of abuse 2.1 Possible signs of abuse include, but are not limited to: 2.1.1 the pupil says he / she has been abused or asks a question or makes a comment which gives rise to that inference 2.1.2 there is no reasonable or consistent explanation for a pupil's injury, the injury is unusual in kind or location or there have been a number of injuries and there is a pattern to the injuries 2.1.3 the pupil's behaviour stands out from the group as either being extreme model behaviour or extremely challenging behaviour, or there is a sudden or significant change in the pupil's behaviour 2.1.4 the pupil asks to drop subjects or an activity with a particular member of staff and seems reluctant to discuss the reasons 2.1.5 the pupil's development is delayed, the pupil loses or gains weight or there is deterioration in the pupil's general wellbeing 30 2.1.6 the pupil appears neglected, e.g. dirty, hungry, inadequately clothed 2.1.7 the pupil is reluctant to go home, or has been openly rejected by his / her parents or carers and 2.1.8 inappropriate behaviour displayed by other members of staff or any other person working with children, for example inappropriate sexual comments; excessive one to one attention beyond the requirements of their usual role or responsibilities; or inappropriate sharing of images. 2.1 Gloucestershire Safeguarding Children Partnership can provide advice on the signs of abuse and the DfE advice What to do if you're worried a child is being abused (2015) provides advice in identifying child abuse. The NSPCC website is also a good source of information and advice on what to do if you’re worried that a child is being abused, including a list of signs of abuse: https://www.nspcc.org.uk/what-is-child-abuse/types-of-abuse/ 3 Radicalisation and the Prevent duty 3.1 Cheltenham College has a legal duty to have due regard to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism. 3.2 Cheltenham College aims to build pupils’ resilience to radicalisation by promoting fundamental British values and enabling them to challenge extremist views.

Cheltenham College is committed to providing a safe space in which children, young people and staff can understand the risks associated with terrorism and develop the knowledge and skills to be able to challenge extremist arguments. 3.3 Cheltenham College has adopted the Government's definitions for the purposes of compliance with the Prevent duty, https://www.educateagainsthate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ Prevent-Duty-Guidance-Schools-and-early-years-providers-briefing-note-1.pdf Extremism: \"vocal or active opposition to fundamental British values, including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs. We also include in our definition of extremism calls for the death of members of our armed forces, whether in this country or overseas\" Radicalisation: \"the process by which a person comes to support terrorism and forms of extremism leading to terrorism\" Terrorism: “an action that endangers or causes serious violence to a person/people; causes serious damage to property; or seriously interferes or disrupts an electronic system. The use or threat must be designed to influence the government or to intimidate the public and is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause.” 3.4 There is no single way of identifying an individual who is likely to be susceptible to a terrorist ideology. As with managing other safeguarding risks, staff should be alert to changes in children’s behaviour which could 31 indicate that they may be in need of help or protection. Children at risk of radicalisation may display different signs or seek to hide their views. Cheltenham College staff should use their professional judgement in identifying children who might be at risk of radicalisation and act proportionately. In particular, outward expressions of faith, in the absence of any other indicator of vulnerability, will not be regarded as a reason to make a referral to Channel. 3.5 Channel Duty Guidance: Protecting vulnerable people from being drawn into terrorism (2020) notes the following: 36. There is no single way of identifying who is likely to be vulnerable to being drawn into terrorism. Factors that may have a bearing on someone becoming vulnerable may include: peer pressure, influence from other people or via the internet, bullying, crime against them or their involvement in crime, anti-social behaviour, family tensions, race/hate crime, lack of self-esteem or identity and personal or political grievances. 51. Example indicators that an individual is engaged with an extremist group, cause or ideology include: • spending increasing time in the company of other suspected extremists; • changing their style of dress or personal appearance to accord with the group; • day-to-day behaviour becoming increasingly centred around an extremist ideology, group or cause; • loss of interest in other friends and activities not associated with the extremist ideology, group or cause; • possession of material or symbols associated with an extremist cause (e.g. the swastika for far-right groups); • attempts to recruit others to the group/cause/ideology; or • communications with others that suggest identification with a group/cause/ideology. 52. Example indicators that an individual has an intention to cause harm, use violence or other illegal means include: • clearly identifying another group as threatening what they stand for and blaming that group for all social or political ills; • using insulting or derogatory names or labels for another group; • speaking about the imminence of harm from the other group and the importance of action now; • expressing attitudes that justify offending on behalf of the group, cause or ideology; • condoning or supporting violence or harm towards others; or 32 • plotting or conspiring with others.\" 3.6 Protecting children from the risk of radicalisation is part of Cheltenham College's wider safeguarding duties, and is similar in nature to protecting children from other harms (e.g. drugs, gangs, neglect, sexual exploitation), whether these come from within their family or are the product of outside"}

All staff in boarding houses are reminded to be vigilant to ensure pupils wellbeing is safeguarded in respect of these potential dangers. 4.2 Boarding staff should try to make themselves aware of pupils who are in a relationship. Cheltenham College Relationship policy is clear that relationships where there is a significant age difference would be deemed as inappropriate, and HsMs would normally speak to parents about such an issue. 4.3 Sexual relationships between pupils should be reported to the Deputy Head (Pastoral) and will be dealt with in accordance with the Behaviour policy. Illegal sexual relationships would be referred to the relevant authorities, such as GSCP or the Police. 4.4 Staff should be aware of the risk of peer abuse particularly in relation to bullying issues, gender-based violence and sexting and deal with bullying in accordance with the anti-bullying policy. If there is a risk of significant harm to any pupil then that should be considered a safeguarding matter, and reported to the DSL. 4.5 Staff should report any concerns they have over child-on-child sexual violence or harassment to the DSL team. 4.6 Any suspicions should be put on CPOMS so that the DSL team have an overview of all the small pieces of evidence that show a clearer picture of the overall situation in any house or area of school. 33 Appendix 3: Guidance for staff and volunteers on suspecting or hearing a complaint of abuse or another safeguarding concern. Action staff must take 1. A member of staff or volunteer suspecting or hearing a complaint of abuse: i. must listen carefully to the child and keep an open mind. The member of staff should not take a decision as to whether or not the abuse has taken place; ii. must not ask leading questions, i.e. a question which suggests its own answer; iii. must reassure the child but not give a guarantee of absolute confidentiality. The member of staff should explain that they need to pass on the information in accordance with this Policy so that the correct action can be taken; and iv. must keep a sufficient written record of the conversation. The record should include: a) the date and time; b) the place of the conversation; and c) the essence of what was said and done by whom and in whose presence; and must be signed by the person making it, using names and not initials. 2. The written record and all other evidence, for example, scribbled notes, mobile phones containing text messages, clothing, computers, must be kept securely and passed on when reporting the matter in accordance with paragraph 3 below. 3. All suspicions or complaints of abuse must be reported to the Designated Safeguarding Lead as soon as possible, unless it is an allegation against a member of staff in which case the procedures set out in Appendix 4 should be followed. 4. If, at any point, there is a risk of immediate serious harm to a child a referral should be made to children's social care immediately. Anybody can make a referral. If the child's situation does not appear to be improving the staff member with concerns should escalate their concerns for re-consideration. 5. Staff should be mindful of abuse from one pupil or more against another pupil, or child on child abuse. Reference should be made to Cheltenham College Anti-bullying policy. A bullying incident should be treated as"}

Staff should be mindful of abuse from one pupil or more against another pupil, or child on child abuse. Reference should be made to Cheltenham College Anti-bullying policy. A bullying incident should be treated as a child protection concern when there is reasonable cause to suspect that a child is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm. 6. If a pupil reports sexual abuse it is essential that any victim is reassured that they are being taken seriously and that they will be supported and kept safe. A victim should never be given the impression that they are creating a problem by reporting sexual violence or sexual harassment. Nor should a victim ever be made to feel ashamed for making a report. As with any allegation of abuse staff should not promise confidentiality, should listen carefully to the victim and not ask leading questions. It will be important to ensure the victim knows that the information will be passed on to professionals who know how to deal with such cases. As always, fill in an Incident on CPOMS as soon as possible, and refer to a DSL. 34 7. If a member of staff is concerned about a pupil always try to speak to that pupils’ Head of Section or Housemaster / Housemistress (HsM). They may ask you to speak to a DSL or to fill in an incident on CPOMS. 8. CPOMS (Child Protection Online Management System) provides a means for Heads of Section, HsMs and DSL teams to keep an eye on all issues pertaining to particular pupil. 35 Appendix 4: Dealing with allegations against members of staff, the Head, Council Member, contractors or volunteers 1. Cheltenham College's procedures a. Cheltenham College's procedures for dealing with allegations made against staff will be used where the member of staff, the Head , Council or volunteer has: i. behaved in a way that has harmed a child, or may have harmed a child; ii. possibly committed a criminal offence against or related to a child; or iii. behaved towards a child or children in a way that indicates he or she may pose a risk of harm if he or she work regularly or closely with children. iv. behaved or may have behaved in a way that indicates they may not be suitable to work with children b. Any allegations not meeting this criteria will be dealt with in accordance with the Gloucestershire Safeguarding Children Partnership procedures. Advice from the designated officer will be sought in borderline cases. c. All such allegations must be dealt with as a priority without delay, and should be reported within one working day. d. If a crime may have been committed, the matter will be reported to the police. e. Allegations against a teacher who is no longer teaching and historical allegations will be referred to the LADO, and the police as directed by the LADO. f. It is very rare for Cheltenham College to engage supply staff, but if the school did and any safeguarding concerns were raised we would investigate this matters in the same way we would for any member of staff. g. If an allegation is received relating to an incident that happened when an individual or organisation was using the school premises, the appropriate action will be taken in accordance with this policy and will include informing the LADO. 2. Reporting an allegation against a member of staff (including the DSL), the Head, Council Member, contractor or volunteer, an authorised individual or someone from an organisation using the school premises. a. Where an allegation or complaint is made against any member of staff, the Designated Safeguarding Lead or a volunteer, the matter should be reported immediately to the Head, or in his /her absence to the Nominated Safeguarding Council Member. The allegation will"}

Where an allegation or complaint is made against any member of staff, the Designated Safeguarding Lead or a volunteer, the matter should be reported immediately to the Head, or in his /her absence to the Nominated Safeguarding Council Member. The allegation will be discussed immediately with the designated officer before further action is taken. Where an allegation or complaint is made against the Head, the matter should be reported immediately to the President of Council or the Nominated Safeguarding Council Member, without first notifying the Head. The allegation will be discussed immediately with the designated officer before further action is taken. The President of Council will consult the Nominated Safeguarding Council Member, and vice versa. b. Where an allegation is made against any Council Member, the matter should be reported immediately to the President of Council or the Nominated Safeguarding 36 Council Member. The allegation will be discussed immediately with the designated officer before further action is taken. Where appropriate, the President of Council will consult the Nominated Safeguarding Council Member, and vice versa. c. Where an allegation is made against an individual using the school premises, the matter should be reported immediately to the Head, or in their absence, to the Nominated Safeguarding Council Member. The allegation will be discussed immediately with the designated officer before any further action is taken. d. For any allegation that is made outside of term-time, follow the guidance later in this section. e. If it is not possible to report to the Head or President of Council or Nominated Safeguarding Council Member in the circumstances set out above, a report should be made immediately to the Senior Deputy Head (in the Senior School) and the DSL is the Prep School and if he/she is unavailable, one of the Deputy Designated Safeguarding Leads. Action will be taken in accordance with these procedures and will as soon as possible inform the Head or, where appropriate, the President of Council and the Nominated Safeguarding Council Member. f. The person taking action in accordance with the procedures in this Appendix is known as the \"Case Manager\". 3. Disclosure of information a. The case manager will inform the accused person of the allegation as soon as possible after the designated officer has been consulted. b. The Parents or carers of the child[ren] involved will be informed of the allegation as soon as possible if they do not already know of it. They will also be kept informed of the progress of the case, including the outcome of any disciplinary process. The timing and extent of disclosures, and the terms on which they are made, will be dependent upon and subject to the laws on confidence and data protection and the advice of external agencies. c. Where the Designated Officer advises that a strategy discussion is needed, or the police or children's social care need to be involved, the case manager will not inform the accused or the parents or carers until these agencies have been consulted and it has been agreed what information can be disclosed. d.

Concerns, regardless of how minor they may appear should be raised without hesitation. This approach is essential for safeguarding both children and adults. To support this aim, College has introduced a mechanism for staff to raise any small concerns which might otherwise not be discussed and learnt from. What is a Low-Level Concern? Any concern – no matter how small, even if no more than a ‘nagging doubt’ – that an adult working in or on behalf of the school may have acted in a way that: • is inconsistent with the staff code of conduct, including inappropriate conduct outside of work and • does not meet the harm threshold or is otherwise not serious enough to consider a referral to the LADO. • relates to their conduct (including outside of work) and which, even if not linked to a particular act or omission, has caused a sense of unease about that adult’s suitability to work with children. The process is intended and designed to ensure colleagues are able to support each other in self-reflection and learning. When is it a Low Level Concern? Staff do not need to be completely sure in each case that their concern is a low level concern in order to raise a worry, that determination can be made by the Senior Deputy Head (College) or the DSL in the prep school. However, the information below may act as a guide: What is an allegation? Behaviour which indicates that an adult who works with children has: • Behaved in a way that has harmed a child, or may have harmed a child; • Possibly committed a criminal offence against or related to a child; • Behaved towards a child or children in a way that indicates they may pose a risk of harm to children ACTION: report to Head as a matter of urgency. Examples of such behaviour could include, but are not limited to: • being over friendly with children • having favourites • taking photographs of children on their mobile phone, contrary to school policy • engaging with a child on a one-to-one basis in a secluded area or behind a closed door, or • humiliating pupils. ACTION: report to Head or SDH/DSL as promptly as possible, ideally through: • concerns@cheltenhamcollege.org (College) • prep.concerns@cheltenhamcollege.org (Prep) 40 Appropriate Conduct Behaviour which is entirely consistent with the school’s Code of Conduct, and the law. NO ACTION REQUIRED How to Talk Through or Raise a Low-Level Concern Please include details of the concern, who it is about, their job role and department if you know it, your name and the date and time in your email. Cheltenham College continues to train HoDs, HoSs and HSMs who also provide a listening ear and source of informal advice. Supportive feedback and coaching may come from your Hod, HoS or HSM if a Low Level Concern is raised about you, or you self-refer."}

Cheltenham College continues to train HoDs, HoSs and HSMs who also provide a listening ear and source of informal advice. Supportive feedback and coaching may come from your Hod, HoS or HSM if a Low Level Concern is raised about you, or you self-refer. A Supportive and Collaborative Approach Staff should be reassured that such Low Level Concerns will be dealt with in a sensitive, discreet, and supportive manner which will centre on collaborative working and coaching to enable all colleagues to maintain the ethos and values of the organisation. College is keenly aware that behaviour outside normal expected standards may indicate that a member of staff is under work or personal pressure and may simply need understanding and support to get through a difficult time. Raising a concern about a colleague in these circumstances will be helpful in ensuring your colleague gets the right help. You will be taking the role of a supportive and critical friend in a way which is protective for your colleague. Staff should feel confident to self-refer where, for example, they find themselves in a situation which could be misinterpreted, might appear compromising to others, and/or on reflection they believe they have behaved in such a way that they might consider falls below the expected professional standards. Self-referrals demonstrate effective self-awareness and a desire to learn and improve which is positively encouraged and is protective for everyone. Low Level Concerns will not be classed as safeguarding concerns unless the DSL determines that they form part of a wider pattern which gives rise to a more serious concern. Where this judged to be the case then the Head and, normally, the LADO will be informed. The SDH/DSL will, as is always the case, work in close partnership with the Head. In line with the recommendations in KCSIE 2025, Part 4, paragraph 432, Low Level Concerns will be recorded and held outside both the formal Safeguarding records and the employee’s 41 formal personnel file. Staff will always have the chance to talk through any concerns raised and give their point of view. They will be given a copy of the record of any Low-Level Concerns before the file is completed so that the record is transparent to them. It may sometimes be the case that the identity of the person raising the report will be anonymised. In line with Keeping Children safe in Education, the following guidance will be adhered to: a. that if the concern has been raised by a third party the SDH/DSL/Head must collect as much evidence as possible by speaking where possible with the person who raised the concern, to the individual involved and to any witnesses b. reports about supply staff and contractors should be notified to their employers so that any potential patterns of inappropriate behaviour can be identified c. that the Head is the ultimate decision-maker and d. that record of low-level concerns should be reviewed so that patterns of concerning, problematic or inappropriate behaviour can be identified and responded to. Where a pattern of behaviour is identified, the school should decide on a course of action. This may be internal disciplinary procedures, or referral to the LADO if the harms threshold is met. The school must consider if any wider cultural issues in school enabled the behaviour to occur and if appropriate policies could be revised or extra training delivered to minimise the risk of recurrence Low Level Concerns will be dealt with in a way which best suits the supportive aims of the process, in most cases this will be a coaching conversation, but it will follow the broad steps set out in the process flow below.

Supporting the Aim of the Process The aim of this process is to provide a mechanism where we can all feel comfortable to support each other to remain mindful of our duty of care to the children we look after. College will take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that we act as colleagues and use this process fairly. Should it be determined that an internal allegation about a member of staff has been raised with malicious intent, then this will be dealt with through the College disciplinary processes College Policies Staff may also wish to refer to the following documents: The Staff Code of Conduct (of which this process is an appendix) The Disciplinary Policy and Procedure The Capability Policy The Grievance Policy The Whistleblowing Policy Organisational Self Reflection It is important that both schools also have the opportunity to review and reflect on low level concerns in a broader way. This may help to identify changes in ways of working which better support our aspirations to function as a safe and supportive community in which both our pupils and our staff enjoy school life and thrive. The SDH/DSL and Head will work in close partnership to ensure there is opportunity for organisational reflection. 42 43 *In the College, the Senior Deputy Head who is part of the DSL team will manage the LLC procedures described above.

A: You can seek informal advice from your school designated safeguarding lead/Senior Deputy Head. Q: What should you do if you have a low level concern about the DSL? A: You can seek advice from your Head. If that is not possible or you feel uncomfortable in approaching the Head, you may go and talk to HR. The most important thing is that you tell someone who can support you to think through what to do next. Q: Can I make an anonymous report? A: We want this process to be as open as possible. It is designed to coach people to improve and to support them if they are struggling. However, your name might be anonymised on the low-level concerns record in certain circumstances.

Q: If a low level concern is reported about me where will it be stored? A: This will be kept in a separate record away from either CPOMS or your personnel record. The Head, the SDH/DSL and senior managers in HR will be able to access this record. Q: How long will you keep a low-level concern on file? A: We will keep it for as long as you remain an employee and then for the same amount of time that we keep your personnel record once you have left. This is important to help us spot patterns to better support you and to support the anonymised organisational self-reflection process. 45 Appendix 6: Role and Duties of the Nominated Safeguarding Council Member and the President of Council Overview The Council of Cheltenham College acknowledge and understand that they have collective duties and responsibilities to safeguard and promote the welfare of children and to ensure that Cheltenham College’s safeguarding policies, procedures and training are effective and comply with the law at all times. The Council is determined to promote the well-being of children within Cheltenham College’s care and recognises that well-being extends beyond the protection from harm and neglect into areas such as promoting: • Physical and mental health and emotional wellbeing. • Social and economic wellbeing. • Opportunities for education, training and recreation. • Opportunities for contributing to society. The Council has nominated one of its members to champion best safeguarding practice in Cheltenham College, supporting the Council not just to discharge its duties under legislation and guidance but to move beyond regulatory compliance. The Nominated Safeguarding Council Member will: • Support the Council in its commitment to promote the well-being of children within Cheltenham College’s care. • Take leadership of Cheltenham College’s safeguarding arrangements, liaising with external agencies where this is required. The appointment of the Nominated Safeguarding Council Member on the terms set out below forms part of the Council’s acceptance of and response to its duties, not a delegation or abrogation of them. Statutory Guidance Statutory guidance ‘Keeping Children Safe in Education (September 2024) defines safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children as: • providing help and support to meet the needs of children as soon as problems emerge • Protecting children from maltreatment. • Preventing impairment of children’s health or development. • Ensuring children are growing up in circumstances consistent with the provision of safe and effective care. • Taking action to enable all children to have the best outcomes. Statutory guidance, ‘Working Together to Safeguard Children 2023’ requires a wide range of institutions, including independent schools, to have arrangements in place that reflect the importance of safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children, including: • A clear line of accountability for the provision of services, designed to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. • A senior board level lead to take leadership responsibility for Cheltenham College’s safeguarding arrangements. 46 • A culture of listening to children and taking account of their wishes and feelings, both in individual decisions and the development of services. • Clear whistleblowing procedures, suitable referenced in staff training and codes of conduct, and a culture that enables issues about safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children to be addressed. • Arrangements, which set out clearly the processes for sharing information with other professionals and with the Local Safeguarding Children Partnership. • A designated professional lead for safeguarding. • Appropriate supervision and support for staff, including undertaking safeguarding training. • Clear policies in line with those from the Local Safeguarding Children Partnership for dealing with allegations against people who work with children.

The ‘Prevent Duty Guidance for England and Wales (2023) emphasises that the duty to have due regard to the need to prevent children from being drawn into terrorism is an aspect of safeguarding. Being drawn into terrorism includes not just violent extremism but also non-violent extremism, which can create an atmosphere conducive to terrorism and can popularise views which terrorists exploit. Role and Duties The main role and duties of the Nominated Safeguarding Council Member on behalf of the Council (which retains overall responsibility) are to: • Champion the promotion of well-being, safeguarding and child protection issues at the highest level within Cheltenham College. • Encourage other members of Council to develop their understanding of the Council’s responsibilities with regard to well-being, safeguarding and child protection and support them in the performance of these duties. • Ensure that the Council puts in place a suitable child protection and safeguarding policy (CPS Policy) and associated procedures, which have proper regard to prevailing regulations, guidance, standards and advice. • Be familiar with the Local Safeguarding Children Partnership guidance and procedures relating to safeguarding and child protection and associated issues, contributing to inter-agency working. • Contribute to ensuring any deficiencies in Cheltenham College’s safeguarding practices brought to Council’s attention from any source are investigated and addressed. • Meet regularly with Cheltenham College’s Designated Safeguarding Lead in order to monitor the effectiveness of Cheltenham College’s CPS Policy and procedures and the implementation of these across the school. It is recommended that this is at least a termly meeting. • Ensure that the Council receives a report on the implementation of Cheltenham College’s CPS Policy and procedures to support the full Council’s review of the safeguarding at the school at least annually (or earlier if needed in response to changes to the law, policy or statutory guidance or as appropriate in response to specific incidents) in accordance with all statutory guidance and guidelines adopted by the Council. 47 • Alert the Council to any incident, which the Nominated Safeguarding Council member regards as a substantiated safeguarding incident. • Ensure that the Designated Safeguarding Lead is part of Cheltenham College’s Senior Leadership Teams and has sufficient time and resources at his/her disposal to carry out his/her duties effectively. • Ensure that a Deputy Designated Safeguarding Lead is identified. • Ensure that the Designated Safeguarding Lead and Deputy Designated Safeguarding Lead receive appropriate training at least every two years. • Ensure that arrangements are in place for the inclusion of child protection training on Cheltenham College’s procedures in an induction programme for all people working in Cheltenham College, no matter for how long, nor the status of that individual. • Ensure safer recruitment procedures are in place and implemented with appropriate checks undertaken on all new staff and volunteers. • Review Cheltenham College’s Single Central Register on at least a termly basis, after undertaking sufficient training to be able to interrogate the register and identify potential deficiencies. It is recommended that at least one review per year is on an unannounced basis. • Be aware of how safeguarding and child protection issues, including guidance on adjusting behaviours to reduce risks, the safer use of electronic devices, social media and the internet and advice on who to turn to for help, are properly addressed through the curriculum and schemes of work. • Ensure that the Council carries out regular risk assessment of factors particular to Cheltenham College which have a bearing on the profile of particular well-being and safeguarding issues, such as (without limitation) historical concerns, looked after children, mental health, body image, self-harm, children missing education, radicalisation, pupils performing a caring role at home, children with special needs or learning difficulties, those for whom"}

The identity of and contact details for the Nominated Safeguarding Council Member, together with an outline of his/her duties will be widely publicised within Cheltenham College community to ensure that pupils, parents, staff and Council members understand the purpose and importance of the role. To the extent that the role and duties of the Nominated Safeguarding Council Member conflict with those assumed by others within Cheltenham College, including the President of Council, the Council will take all necessary action to resolve those conflicts so as to achieve clarity about respective roles and duties. This may include amendments to the CPS Policy, Cheltenham College’s constitutional documents and/or other governance arrangements applicable to Cheltenham College. 48 Each of the Nominated Safeguarding Council Member and the President of Council will undertake appropriate training in accordance with the Local Safeguarding Children Partnership’s recommendations to fulfil the respective role and duties. Allegations against staff Cheltenham College’s CPS Policy sets out the detail of who is responsible for liaising with the local authority designated officer(s) in the event of allegations of abuse made against the Head, proprietor, member of Council or member of staff of Cheltenham College. Where the Nominated Safeguarding Council Member is responsible for taking the lead in liaising with the local authority and/or other partner agencies, he/she will: • Notify the designated officer of the local authority immediately before any action is taken. • Ensure, with local authority support, that appropriate action is taken in accordance with agreed Local Safeguarding Children Partnership’s procedures • Attend initial and subsequent strategy meetings as required if other agencies are involved. • Oversee an investigation under Cheltenham College’s internal employment procedures when the other agencies’ involvement is at an end or as soon as it is confirmed that this may take place. • With the Designated Safeguarding Lead, review Cheltenham College’s CPS Policy and procedures, taking advice from the designated officer of the local authority and making the necessary changes. At the conclusion of a case in which an allegation is substantiated, the Nominated Safeguarding Council Member will conduct a review of the circumstances of the case seeking appropriate input from within and outside Cheltenham College to determine whether there are any improvements to be made to Cheltenham College’s procedures or practice to help prevent similar events in the future. The Nominated Safeguarding Council Member will ensure that a full report is available for Council. Appointment of the Nominated Safeguarding Council Member The Nominated Safeguarding Council Member is Emma Hattersley and can be contacted in the following ways: • By email: CPCouncil@cheltenhamcollege.org • By telephone via the Secretary to Council: 01242 265686 If the Nominated Safeguarding Council Member is unavailable, his/her duties will be carried out by the President of Council. The appointment of the Nominated Safeguarding Council Member has been made by Council after full consideration of the roles and responsibilities and the qualities required by potential candidates to discharge them effectively. 49 Appendix 7: Information sharing and Confidentiality Guidance Information sharing Concerns about pupils should never be discussed inside or outside of College, unless in confidential meetings or in a space that guarantees confidentiality.

As such information should never be discussed in a public forum. If there is an emergency and there is a need to have a conversation in order to safeguard the health and welfare of a pupil, it is still important to consider whether the surroundings offer a degree of confidentiality and to seek a more appropriate environment in order to deal with that issue. There will be times when members of staff are expected to liaise and share information with external agencies such as LADO or Children’s Services such as Early Help or with the MASH. Confidentiality and GDPR should never be a barrier to information sharing; indeed, Information sharing is essential for effective safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children and young people and it is a key factor identified in many serious case reviews (SCRs), where poor information sharing has resulted in missed opportunities to take action that keeps children and young people safe. In order to safeguard pupils effectively while respecting confidentiality and data protection obligations, Cheltenham College ensures that the Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL), or a member of the safeguarding team, shares information appropriately and securely. In most cases, the DSL will be the person responsible for making decisions about information sharing. They should be open and honest with the pupil and, where appropriate, their family about why, what, how, and with whom information will or may be shared, and seek agreement unless doing so would be unsafe or inappropriate. If there is any uncertainty about whether information should be shared, the DSL should seek advice from the Data Protection Manager. Under the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018, information may be shared without consent if there is a lawful basis to do so, such as when a pupil’s safety may be at risk. To support this judgement, the DSL should complete a Signs of Safety Assessment, available in the DSL folder on Teams, and base decisions on the facts of the case. When sharing or requesting personal information, the DSL must be clear about the legal basis for doing so, ensure that the information is necessary for the intended purpose, and share it only with individuals who need to know. All shared information must be accurate, up to date, and transmitted securely using systems such as Egress or encrypted email. A record of decisions to share or not share information must be logged on CPOMS. Where information is shared with external agencies, a record should be kept detailing what was shared, with whom, and the purpose of the disclosure. Sharing information with Local Authority Safeguarding Services At Cheltenham College, the DSL is responsible for ensuring that any concerns about a pupil’s welfare are appropriately shared with external agencies, including the local authority’s Children’s Social Care services, in line with statutory duties. Under Section 17 of the Children Act 1989, the DSL may share relevant information to support the local authority’s duty to assess and provide services to children in need. This includes contributing to early help assessments and ensuring that appropriate support is in place at the right time. Where there are more serious concerns, under Section 47 of the 50 Children Act 1989, the DSL will share information to support child protection enquiries when there is reasonable cause to suspect that a child is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm. Wherever possible, consent will be sought from parents or carers prior to sharing information. However, if there is concern that seeking consent may place the child at increased risk of harm, information may be shared without consent, provided it is necessary and proportionate to protect the child. The DSL will maintain a clear and detailed record of the rationale for any decisions made regarding information sharing. All decisions and actions will be recorded on"}

The DSL will maintain a clear and detailed record of the rationale for any decisions made regarding information sharing. All decisions and actions will be recorded on CPOMs. Sharing information with the police The Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL) may share information with the police where it is necessary for the prevention, detection, prosecution of crime, or where a pupil is at risk of significant harm. Under the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018, Cheltenham College may lawfully disclose personal data to the police for law enforcement purposes, provided there is a clear legal basis for doing so. Where the request involves special category data the DSL must ensure that the appropriate conditions under Articles 9 and 10 of the UK GDPR and Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act 2018 are met. In most cases, this will be under Schedule 1, Paragraph 10, which permits disclosure for the prevention or detection of unlawful acts where seeking consent would prejudice those purposes. Requests from the police should be made in writing and clearly state the necessity of the request. Where possible, the police should complete an Interim Third-Party Material Request Form. All disclosures must be recorded on CPOMS, including the rationale for sharing, the information shared, the recipient and the method of transmission. Information must be shared securely using encrypted/password protected email or approved platforms such as Egress. In emergency situations, the DSL may share information without delay if it is necessary, proportionate and should document the action taken as soon as possible afterwards. The DSL should also confirm with the police whether the individual concerned can be informed of the disclosure, particularly in relation to subject access requests. Medical Confidentiality In a school setting, medical confidentiality means respecting a pupil’s right to privacy whilst balancing this against the risks of their individual case within the boarding school setting and telling those who need to know in order to keep that person safe. Passing on medical information to other people is usually done with the permission of the pupil. The decision to breach confidentiality against a pupil's wishes is one that is taken extremely seriously and is only done when there is felt to be a significant risk of harm to the pupil if the information is not shared. Respecting patient confidentiality is an essential part of good care; this applies when the patient is a child or young person as well as when the patient is an adult. Without the trust that confidentiality brings, children and young people might not seek medical care and advice, or they might not tell us all the facts needed to provide good care. 51 Telling parents /guardians Each pupil has a right to confidentiality, but the school should encourage the pupil to allow their parents to be contacted unless communicating with parents could pose a safeguarding risk to that young person. In this case, the DSL must be consulted. If the child is a day pupil or a day boarder this need becomes ever more pressing, and there may be situations where the child’s welfare away from school means parents must be contacted. The right to confidentiality becomes more absolute as the pupil ages and matures. The school medical team uses the principles of Gillick Competency to make decisions about this. There is no set of defined questions to assess Gillick competency. Professionals need to consider several things when assessing a child's capacity to consent, including: • the child's age, maturity and mental capacity • their understanding of the issue and what it involves - including advantages, disadvantages and potential long-term impact • their understanding of the risks, implications and consequences that may arise from their decision • how well they understand any advice or information they have been"}

The Fraser guidelines may also apply within College in pupils who are under 16 year. They apply specifically to advice and treatment about contraception and sexual health. If the child is under 13 the parents must be informed and consent to the treatment plan. If the young person is over 13 and not registered with the College medical team then their parents may have to be informed if the school has concerns as they are the only ones who can ensure that the young person sees their own GP. Only their own GP can refer them to appropriate external services. At 16 it is legally presumed young people have the capacity to make decisions about their own care. People with capacity are allowed to make decisions that we do not agree with, but some situations are not compatible with continuing to remain in the boarding environment. If a pupil is in that position then they will be assessed according to our Mental Health Assessment Policy and discussed within the Welfare Management Team to determine if they are fit to board. It is vital that pupils are supported to understand the complexity of their own situation, and to make decisions that recognise this. In some situations where there is deemed to be a serious safeguarding concern regarding a pupil’s health, or that of another, the DSL team will be informed and parents subsequently notified. The level of risk would need to be carefully assessed. Our Health Centre team, including our psychotherapists, will always try to gain a pupil’s permission to involve parents, although that may not always be possible. If the decision is taken to start medication that has a wider significance e.g. antidepressants in a pupil who is boarding, then the school doctors will routinely discuss sharing this information with the HsM and their parents. In the vast majority of cases pupils are willing for this information to be shared. If the pupil is adamant that they are not willing to share the information then the school doctors will only agree to prescribe after a thorough risk assessment, and with appropriate safeguards in place e.g. weekly prescriptions, regular doctor or nurse reviews. Careful thought will be given to the holiday periods and ensuring that pupils are not given large quantities of medication to take home if parents are unaware of the prescription. In addition, where possible support will be offered via Teams over the 52 holiday. If a pupil does not give consent to school or parental involvement at the initial consultation this should not be the end of the conversation, and it should be discussed regularly to ensure that the situation has not changed with regard to their level of risk. At all times the pupil’s welfare will be used as the focus for our decision making. Moving Practitioners Students over the age of 16 have the right to move their health practitioner without their parents’ consent. For boarding pupils, it is generally a condition of them being at College that they are registered under our practice. Students can choose to see a different doctor in our practice if they so wish. For day and day boarding pupils registered with another practice, College would not be involved in any decision to move practitioner unless it had been advised that for exceptional reasons they register at our practice.

For day and day boarding pupils registered with another practice, College would not be involved in any decision to move practitioner unless it had been advised that for exceptional reasons they register at our practice. Referral Protocols for Nurses The Health Centre provides a safe environment where our school nurses can have private consultations with Pupils and staff. Consultations with the school nurses are treated as confidential unless there is a concern for the safety of that pupil or for others within College. If the nurse feels that a pupil has raised an issue where they would benefit from support from their teachers or parents, they will strongly encourage them to give consent for the nurse to discuss it and for the pupils themselves to be open with their parents or HsM, with support if necessary. There will be times when the nurse feels it is in the child’s best interest to breach their confidentiality. This will be in cases where there is concern for the pupil’s safety, for example, in the case of self-harm and/or suicidal ideation. In some cases, the concern may be low level and can therefore be referred to the Assistant Head (Safeguarding & Pupil Welfare) for information only. The purpose of this, is because the Assistant Head (safeguarding & Pupil Welfare) holds information from a variety of different sources and as DSL will also hold confidential safeguarding information. The Assistant Head (safeguarding & Pupil Welfare) can therefore escalate the concern if there is a need. In other cases, if the concern is more serious and involves any form of abuse, then this matter must be raised as a safeguarding concern through CPOMs. There will be other times when the pupil has been sent to the Health Centre by the HsM as part of our self-harm policy or due to other concerns they may have, for example around eating or low mood. In these cases, unless there is good reason not to, then it is important that an update is provided via CPOMs at the earliest opportunity. The following flow diagram should be used as guidance as to when and how to refer. 53 Low risk (Early help) -One off incident which caused minimal injury and is without expression of further intent. As per the self-harm policy, if the pupil is under 13, this needs to be recorded on CPOMs. If the pupils is over 13 and is Fraser competent then this can be managed within the HC. The DPW needs to be informed either via phone or through email. All emails needs to recorded as confidential. At this stage pupils should be signposted to appropriate in house support such as Student Support Services and/or the College Doctor. Medium Risk (Pupil with complex needs) -One off incident which caused serious harm and/or repeated expressions of intent for further harm. -Intervention and support work is failing to reduce the risk of self harm and/or suicidal ideation. -Disclosure of abuse (including child on child) or any concerns related to online grooming If the pupil is not at immediate risk of harm, then concerns should be recorded on CPOMs under the right category – this needs to be recorded on the day. High Risk (pupil in acute need) -Significant harm, for example, for example, the pupil’s actions could result in their death or serious injury requiring hospital admission. -Disclosure of abuse which could result in significant and/or immediate harm. You may want to follow this up with a phone call to the DSL/AH (S&PW)/HSM Immediate phone call to the AH (S&PW)/College Doctor/HsM depending on the nature of the concern. Please make sure all your notes are then recorded on to CPOMs as soon as you can after you have spoken to the appropriate person. 54 Appendix 8 – Safeguarding Records Transfer Protocol Cheltenham College is committed to ensuring that safeguarding records are transferred securely, promptly, and in line with statutory guidance and best"}

This appendix outlines the College’s procedures for reviewing, redacting, and transferring safeguarding records when a pupil moves to another educational setting. These procedures comply with: • Keeping Children Safe in Education (KCSIE) 2024, which mandates the timely and secure transfer of child protection files to a pupil’s new school or college, • UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018, which require that personal data be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently, with appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of individuals, Key Principles • Safeguarding records are transferred to ensure continuity of care and protection. • Only information that is relevant, proportionate, and necessary for safeguarding is shared. • Transfers are carried out securely, with oversight from the Designated Safeguarding Lead and the Data Protection Manager. Cheltenham College Procedure Review and Redaction: the DSL will review the safeguarding file prior to transfer. Any excessive, irrelevant, or outdated information will be redacted. This includes the names or identifying details of other pupils, which must be removed unless they are essential to the safeguarding context. If there is any uncertainty about inclusion, the Data Protection Manager will be consulted to support appropriate decision-making. Content to Include: • Chronologies of concern • Records of disclosures, referrals, and DSL decisions • Multi-agency plans (e.g. Child Protection, CiN) • Relevant agency/family correspondence • Risk assessments and contextual safeguarding notes • Behaviour or attendance records only if directly linked to safeguarding Transfer Method and Timescale: Safeguarding files will be transferred within five school days of the pupil starting at the new setting. Transfer of safeguarding records will be carried out via one of the following secure methods: hand delivery, tracked postal service, encrypted digital transfer or direct transfer between CPOMS systems, where the receiving setting uses compatible safeguarding software. Record of Transfer: A log will be maintained including: • Pupil name and destination school • Date and method of transfer • Name of receiving DSL • Confirmation of receipt No Known Destination: If a pupil is removed from roll and no new setting is identified, the DSL will notify the relevant safeguarding partners in line with GSCP CME protocols. 55 The following table serves as a decision-making tool to determine which information should be shared and which should be withheld. All information shared as part of a safeguarding record transfer must adhere to the ‘need to know’ principle. Only details that are necessary, proportionate, and directly relevant to protecting the pupil’s safety and wellbeing should be included. This may include medical or mental health information, such as concerns around self-harm or eating disorders, but only where these present a safeguarding risk or are essential to ensure appropriate ongoing support. 56 Appendix 9 - Safeguarding Children on Child Student Visas Purpose and Context This appendix outlines Cheltenham College’s safeguarding responsibilities in relation to pupils who are sponsored under the Child Student Visa route. Considering increasing concerns from the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) department regarding the abuse of sponsorship routes by international criminal networks, the College recognises the vital importance of additional safeguarding and compliance measures. Criminal exploitation of children under the Child Student Visa route may include trafficking, working illegally, identity fraud, and coercive control. As a licensed sponsor, the College is committed to protecting international pupils and preventing misuse of the visa system. UKVI has highlighted a range of safeguarding risks related to the abuse of the Child Student Visa route by criminal networks, fraudulent agents, and individuals seeking to exploit the vulnerability of children and young people entering the UK as students. These risks include: Human Trafficking and"}

UKVI has highlighted a range of safeguarding risks related to the abuse of the Child Student Visa route by criminal networks, fraudulent agents, and individuals seeking to exploit the vulnerability of children and young people entering the UK as students. These risks include: Human Trafficking and Exploitation • Organised criminal groups may use student visa sponsorship as a legal cover to traffic children into the UK, where they may be forced into exploitative labour, domestic servitude, or criminal activity. • Pupils may be coerced into county lines drug operations, forced begging, or theft, particularly during periods when they are unsupervised or during school holidays. • Exploited children may be made to abscond from school, change guardianship arrangements unofficially, or disappear after entry into the UK. Digital Scams and Online Grooming • Pupils and their families may fall victim to phishing scams, with fraudulent emails purporting to be from: - UK Border Force - Police or immigration authorities - Government departments - Banks or embassy officials • These scams often demand payment of fake fines or visa fees, using threats of deportation or imprisonment. • Pupils may also be targeted by online predators, particularly if they are socially isolated or experiencing difficulties settling into boarding life. • Sextortion threats may include shame-based coercion, particularly targeting cultural values around honour, privacy, and reputation. Isolation, Silence and Fear of Authority • Cultural and language barriers can discourage pupils from disclosing problems, especially if they fear shame, failure, or loss of face. • Some international pupils experience: o Loneliness or homesickness o Pressure to succeed and make their families proud o Fear of bringing shame to their family by reporting abuse or fraud 57 • This creates a barrier to help-seeking, particularly if pupils do not understand UK safeguarding processes or feel uncertain about their rights. Inadequate Guardianship or Supervision • Unregulated, informal, or inappropriate guardian arrangements may leave pupils unprotected during Exeats or holidays. • Pupils may be left in the care of unsuitable adults, without proper DBS checks or safeguarding vetting, and be vulnerable to: o Emotional neglect o Poor supervision o Exposure to unsafe environments o Physical or sexual abuse • Guardians may also delegate care to others without notifying the school, creating further safeguarding gaps. Exploitation by Family Members or Acquaintances • In rare cases, family-arranged guardianship may mask exploitative or abusive relationships. • Pupils may be expected to: o Work informally in homes or businesses o Share cramped living conditions o Act as carers or translators for adults • Their visa status may be used as leverage to control or silence them. Responding to Safeguarding Concerns About International Pupils Cheltenham College is committed to taking swift, proportionate, and child-centred action whenever there is a safeguarding concern involving an international pupil sponsored under the Child Student Visa route. Concerns may be raised internally by staff or students, externally by guardians or agencies, or through patterns of behaviour observed over time. All concerns, no matter how minor they may seem, are taken seriously. Immediate Actions: If a member of staff becomes aware of any concern about an international pupil, they must: • Record the concern immediately and accurately on CPOMS • Inform the Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL) or Deputy DSL if there are immediate concerns. • Ensure the pupil is safe, supported, and listened to in a sensitive and non-judgmental way If there is a risk of immediate harm, the DSL or their deputy will: • Take urgent protective action (e.g. remove the pupil from a harmful environment) • Make a safeguarding referral or if there are immediate concerns, contact the police. • Notify UKVI if the safeguarding concern affects the visa sponsorship or compliance obligations 58 1.

Legal and Statutory Framework This appendix aligns with the following key legislation and statutory guidance: • Education Act 1996, Section 19: Local authorities must arrange suitable, full-time education for children of compulsory school age who cannot attend school due to exclusion, illness, or other reasons • Keeping Children Safe in Education (KCSiE) 2025: Schools remain responsible for safeguarding pupils placed in AP, including those learning remotely • Providing Remote Education Guidance (DfE, 2024): Remote education should be a last resort and must be high-quality, safe, and inclusive • Working Together to Safeguard Children (2023): Emphasises multi-agency collaboration and early intervention. 59 Appendix 10 Safeguarding Pupils in alternative provision and Remote Learning 1. Legal and Statutory Framework This appendix aligns with the following key legislation and statutory guidance: • Education Act 1996, Section 19: Local authorities must arrange suitable, full-time education for children of compulsory school age who cannot attend school due to exclusion, illness, or other reasons • Keeping Children Safe in Education (2025): Schools remain responsible for safeguarding pupils placed in AP, including those learning remotely • Providing Remote Education Guidance (DfE, 2024): Remote education should be a last resort and must be high-quality, safe, and inclusive • Working Together to Safeguard Children (2023): Emphasises multi-agency collaboration and early intervention. • Working Together to improve School Attendance (2024): Schools must safeguard pupils accessing remote education while still on roll, ensuring regular contact and support. Cheltenham College recognises that in certain circumstances, pupils may be unable to attend school in person due to medical, emotional, or behavioral needs. In such cases, alternative provision may include placement in hospital schools, engagement with home tuition services, or access to remote learning platforms. The College remains responsible for safeguarding pupils in these settings, ensuring that all arrangements meet statutory requirements and reflect the principles outlined in its safeguarding framework. Where pupils are receiving remote education due to attendance issues, such as illness, anxiety, or other barriers to physical attendance, Cheltenham College follows the Department for Education’s guidance on providing remote education. This applies specifically to situations where the pupil undertakes remote learning for a period of time while still on roll at Cheltenham College. Safeguarding arrangements include maintaining regular contact, monitoring engagement, and ensuring pupils have access to safe and effective learning environments. The DSL will oversee all safeguarding measures, including risk assessments, online safety protocols, and welfare checks and will specifically: • Obtain written confirmation of safer recruitment checks for AP staff. • Know the exact location of students during school hours. • Review AP placements half-termly to ensure safety and suitability. In all cases, the College aims to support reintegration into full-time education and uphold its commitment to pupil wellbeing and safeguarding, where the pupil remains on roll."}

Rationale and Ethos Cheltenham College is committed to providing high quality relationships and sex education (RSE) to children and young people in order to prepare them for the challenges, opportunities and responsibilities of growing up and becoming adults. The Sex Education Forum defines RSE as learning about the emotional, social and physical aspects of growing up, relationships, sex, human sexuality and sexual health. It should equip children and young people with the information, skills and positive values to have safe, fulfilling relationships, to enjoy their sexuality and to take responsibility for their sexual health and well-being. Relationships and sex education promotes pupils’ wellbeing; it develops skills and understanding within the context of respectful attitudes and values so that pupils can enjoy positive relationships based on equality. Pupils learn about the emotional, social and physical aspects of growing up, relationships, sexual orientation and sexual health. Relationships and sex education is provided in a way that is appropriate to pupils’ stage of development and maturity. It is embedded within the Thrive and Floreat programmes, Cheltenham Prep and College’s respective wellbeing and PSHE programmes. Providing relationships and sex education is a protective factor; evidence from the National Children’s Bureau shows that providing high quality relationships and sex education delays sexual activity for young people and increases the likelihood of using contraception. Provision of this education also protects children and young people from inappropriate online content, cyberbullying and exploitation. RSE at Cheltenham College is fully aligned with the school values and the development of the five C’s (Curiosity, Character, Community, Creativity and Continuous Excellence). Lessons aim to help the development of these personal qualities. Framed by the 5C’s, we believe pupils thrive at Cheltenham College and successful RSE is part the broader aims of PSHE of developing the qualities and attributes pupils need to flourish as individuals, family members and members of society. Cheltenham College is committed to providing relationships and sex education that: • is balanced, broadly based and reflects the values of the school • reflects the needs of its pupils, including their maturity • recognises the role of both school and home in providing this education • takes into account the views of various religious and secular groups on different issues • promotes equality and is inclusive and respectful of difference: race, ethnicity, culture, gender, sexual orientation, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, disability, religion or belief or other life experience • includes the acquisition of knowledge and the development of life skills • has a strong emphasis on: o healthy relationships o consent o rights o responsibilities to others o communication skills o exploitation and abuse o pornography o sharing of nudes and semi-nudes (sexting) o sexual harassment and sexual violence o accessing services • is factually correct and treats sex as a normal fact of life • is taught by trained staff • teaches pupils about the law • promotes equality in relationships • helps pupils enjoy relationships and builds confidence in accessing services • helps pupils stay safe from harm, on and off line by addressing sexual exploitation, abuse, domestic violence and bullying 2. Legislation The Relationships Education, Relationships and Sex Education and Health Education (England) Regulations 2019, made under sections 34 and 35 of the Children and Social Work Act 2017, make Relationships and Sex Education (RSE) compulsory for all pupils receiving secondary education. This policy, along with the delivery of RSE, is written to be in with and implemented alongside the following policies: • Anti-bullying Policy • Child Protection and Safeguarding Policy • E-safety Policy • Learning Support and Special Educational Needs Policy • Pupil Behaviour Policy (both College and Prep) • Curriculum Policy (both College and Prep) In addition, this policy, along with the delivery of RSE, is written in line with the following government guidance and statements: • Relationships"}

Roles and Responsibilities The RSE programme at College will be led by the Head of PSHE/Floreat, Catriona Rees. In the Prep School it is led by Kit Perona-Wright, Assistant Head (Creative Arts, Compliance and Partnership). They produce and review the respective curriculums. In College and The Prep, all year groups are taught in a weekly Floreat/Thrive (PSHE) lesson, delivered by selected teaching staff. The Sixth Form curriculum includes several external speakers. Teaching staff receive RSE training through resources compiled by the Head of PSHE along with INSET time and Learning Lunches. 4. Curriculum Design Our RSE programme is an integral part of our whole school PSHE education provision, and it has been put together through guidance from the PSHE Association. RSE is both proactive and reactionary and changes may be made due to specific events or circumstances. At secondary level, teaching builds on the knowledge acquired at primary and further develops pupils’ understanding of health, with an increased focus on risk areas such as drugs and alcohol, as well as introducing knowledge about intimate relationships, sex and protection from sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy. Teaching about mental wellbeing is central at all levels. Our RSE programme will be taught through a range of teaching methods and interactive activities and high-quality resources will support our RSE provision and will be regularly reviewed. A significant number of resources will be recommended by the PSHE Association. All resources used are carefully selected to be in line with Cheltenham College’s values. Learning about relationships and sex education in PSHE education lessons will compliment and link to similar topics in subjects including Biology, Computer Science and TPE. The Sixth Form curriculum has been developed through an in-depth consultation with pupils, teaching staff and pastoral staff. An overview of the curriculum for both Prep and College can be found in the appendices. The content of lessons is planned carefully to ensure that it is accessible to all learners, including pupils with special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND), who may be more vulnerable to exploitation, bullying and other issues on account of their SEND. 5. Right to Withdraw Parents of children below the age of 16 have the right to request that they be withdrawn from sex education lessons that form part of the Thrive and Floreat RSE lessons; pupils would continue to attend Biology lessons and the relationships element of RSE lessons (which cover topics such as family, friendship and safety, including online safety). Relationships education is viewed as so essential that parents do not have the right to withdraw their children. Such requests for withdrawal from sex education would usually be granted until up to three terms before the child’s 16th birthday, the legal age of consent. At this point, if the child wished to attend sex education lessons, Cheltenham College would arrange for this to happen. A pupil who has been excused would remain so until the request is withdrawn or to the extent or until the Head considers the pupil should not be excused. Before granting a request to excused from sex education, the Head would discuss the request with parent and, as appropriate, their child to ensure that their wishes are understood and to clarify the nature and purpose of the curriculum. Any such request would be documented and kept on record. Any parent of a"}

Any parent of a College pupil wishing to request withdrawal of their child from sex education that forms part of Floreat should contact the Assistant Head (Welfare and Safeguarding): m.lucas-halliwell@cheltenhamcollege.org in the first instance. Any parent of a Prep pupil wishing to request withdrawal of their child from sex education lessons that form part of Thrive! should contact the Deputy Head Pastoral in the first instance. 6. Monitoring, Reporting and Evaluation As with all aspects of our PSHE curriculum, pupils will have opportunities to review and reflect on their learning through formative assessment throughout lessons. Feedback is immediate, constructive and positive. In College, Third, Fourth and Fifth Form, work is completed in the individual Floreat workbooks. In Sixth Form, work is completed in their OneNote online folders. Work is regularly marked by teaching staff and feedback given, both in marked work and orally as part of class discussion. At The Prep, a mixture of written and on-line work is completed. Staff give feedback, both written and oral as part of class discussion. Floreat is reported to parents during Formative Reporting Cycles. Through this, pupils are given the opportunity to reflect on their own development in Floreat. Any behavioural concerns are followed up in line with the school’s Behaviour Management Policy. Teachers critically reflect on their work in delivering RSE through the College’s programme of professional development and there is an annual observation schedule of all Floreat teaching staff by the Head of PSHE and other senior staff. Pupil voice is influential in adapting and amending planned learning activities at both The Prep and College and is used to inform planning through the academic year. Pupils complete online surveys at the beginning and end of each academic year, to feedback on learning and as an opportunity for pupil voice to develop the curriculum. 7. Safeguarding and confidentiality It is important to establish ground rules and a working agreement about RSE lessons. Pupils must be reminded that lessons are not a place to discuss their personal experiences and issues, instead they should be reminded of the many ways in which they can access confidential support outside of lessons, including via the Health Centre. If a pupil tells a teacher or tutor something personal on a one-to-one basis outside of a lesson that is of concern in relation to child protection or safeguarding, the member of staff must follow Cheltenham College’s Child Protection and Safeguarding Policy. They cannot promise confidentially, but the child or young person should be told how the information they have disclosed will be treated by the school. They should be encouraged to involve their parents if appropriate. 8. Engaging parents and other stakeholders It is important that we work in partnership with parents and guardians on the RSE curriculum. Parents will be informed of the programme for RSE the half term before RSE is taught in each year group. The RSE Policy is available on the College website. Where parents have questions, suggestions or concerns about RSE, they are warmly invited to discuss these with College or Prep, in the first instance with Catriona Rees in College and Kit Perona-Wright in the Prep. It is expected that through open discussion, parents and guardians will be reassured at that stage. That said, for any complaints which cannot be resolved through informal discussion, parents and guardians are advised to follow the school’s Complaints Policy. 9.

RSE Policy Review The policy has been produced in consultation with parents and carers. It is reviewed annually to ensure it continues to meet the needs of pupils, staff and parents/guardians and that is in line with current Department of Education advice and guidance. It is approved by senior leaders responsible for oversight of the Thrive! and Floreat programmes. Additional reviews and updates may also occur any time deemed relevant and necessary. Parents will be consulted when the policy is subsequently amended. Appendix 1 – Thrive!

Our aim is that through the implementation of this policy the school community should be able to recognise and understand what behaviour is expected and why. Rewarding positive conduct and work should always be the first priority of the school and unacceptable behaviour should not be allowed to impact on the well-being of others. It is the expectation that all pupils at The Prep will behave in a way that is civilised and civilising; that they will treat all in our community (both within school and the wider community) with kindness, tolerance and respect; that they will not embarrass themselves, others or bring the school into disrepute. The Prep strives to nurture a ‘child safe’ culture; sexism, racism, misogyny/misandry, homophobia, biophobic, sexual harassment and sexual violence and child-on-child abuse, including in any intimate relationship are not tolerated. This extends to on-line communications or social media posts. This policy will be reviewed and approved by the school’s governing body (known as Council) on an annual basis. General Principles for Years 3 to 8 It is generally accepted that while punishment can help to discourage and contain bad behaviour, it can have only a limited effect on the promotion of good behaviour. Corporal punishment is never used at The Prep and the school will always look to promote positive behaviour and reward the good that pupils do, rather than using sanctions i.e. a detention. There are many reasons why a child’s behaviour might deteriorate and these may well lie beyond their immediate education at The Prep. The school therefore has an established network of communication (both internally and with parents) to make sure that we are aware of any broader reasons as to why a child might be finding aspects of school life challenging. This information is shared with the relevant pastoral staff and tutors, so that we can provide the most appropriate support. Early intervention through discussions with pupils will be the starting point in almost all cases, so that a pupil can reflect on why he / she has made a particular decision and this can inform their choices in future. Children whose work performance needs improvement should not be punished using Minuses unless the behaviour surrounding their poor performance is unacceptable. Although The Prep’s expectations and rules relate primarily to school life during term time, there are circumstances in which behaviour ‘off campus’ and, indeed, out of term time will be dealt with by this, and related policies. These would typically include any behaviour that could bring The Prep into disrepute or which has a serious impact on the school community or individuals within it, in either its physical or online environment. The over-arching expectation is one of community, consideration, mutual respect and common sense. It is generally accepted that while sanctions can help to discourage and contain poor behaviour, it can have only a limited effect on the promotion of good behaviour. Prexpectations is an agreed set of values, reviewed by each form in conjunction with their form taker, that underpins our behaviour policy and promotes a culture of kindness and consideration, tolerance and respect. The Prep will always look to promote positive discipline and recognise and celebrate the good that pupils do, rather than using sanctions; corporal punishment is never used and the school will always look to promote positive behaviour and reward the good that pupils do, rather than using sanctions i.e. a detention. If any Prep pupil behaves in a way which"}

If any Prep pupil behaves in a way which raises concern with any member of staff, that behaviour should be addressed predictably, promptly and assertively as soon as possible. The aim of any response to misbehaviour should be to maintain the culture of the school so that all pupils can thrive in a safe, calm and happy environment. Every member of staff should feel that they can speak to a pupil about their behaviour if it is felt to be inappropriate, but they should take into consideration any contributing factors that may have led to that behaviour. The Pupils of Concern list provides up to date information on pupils who may be experiencing particular difficulty at any given time. Responsibilities It is the responsibility of all within the school community to treat everybody with courtesy and respect. Staff: • Work closely with the pastoral leads across each Section of the school and always look to consider what lies behind any behaviour, so that the reasons or causes can be fully understood and supported. • Ensure that all children clearly understand what is meant by good behaviour, based on the Key Skills and Attributes. This is not an exhaustive list but does highlight some of the most important qualities that we expect to see in our pupils throughout the school and is not confined to the classroom. • Ensure that the reason for a rule is understood by all • Be consistent in rewards and sanctions and ensure such actions are communicated to the appropriate members of staff. • Avoid ‘blanket’ punishments • Communicate with parents as appropriate • Model desired behaviour • Written and verbal feedback to pupils should reflect (but not be confined to) the examples set out the Key Skills and Attributes, as well as the Marking Policy. Pre expectations (Years 3 to 8) It is very important that The Prep is a happy, positive and safe place in which to learn. Staff will always make it their priority to support all pupils in every part of their lives in school, not just in the classroom but also in their development as kind, considerate members of the community. In order to make The Prep work as happily and smoothly as possible: • We will show respect for our own and the school’s property, as well as the property of other pupils. • We will arrive punctually for lessons, particularly after breaks and ensure that we are ready to learn. We will only enter the classroom if there is a teacher present and do so quietly and in an orderly fashion. • We will make sure that we have the correct equipment for lessons and game sessions, and if we haven’t, we will speak to a teacher so that they can help us. • We will wear uniform appropriately, with shirts tucked in and ties done up. We will not wear bracelets, necklaces (or earrings for girls). Our form teachers will check our appearance on a daily basis, as will other staff on a regular basis. • We will always speak politely to staff and other pupils, even if we are feeling upset or frustrated. • We will conduct ourselves in a manner that ensures we hold ourselves accountable for our actions. • If a serious problem arises, we will speak to a member of staff if we need help to resolve the situation. • We will treat other people as we would like to be treated ourselves. We know that we are rewarded for good work and behaviour, usually by being awarded a plus or Head’s Commendation. We also understand that on the rare occasions that our"}

We know that we are rewarded for good work and behaviour, usually by being awarded a plus or Head’s Commendation. We also understand that on the rare occasions that our behaviour falls below the levels above, we can expect a sanction, which will normally be a minus. Rewards: Individual rewards It must be understood and accepted that without an equal and consistent contribution from all staff, good behaviour cannot be maintained. Parental support in this respect is essential too. All staff are expected to take an active approach in promoting good behaviour and children should be rewarded for this, wherever and whenever it occurs in school. Whole School and Section Assemblies, Chapel, Form Teacher Periods, Thrive! and the Rewards System provide a particular focus to consolidate and celebrate good behaviour. Verbal Praise Should be used where appropriate to reinforce expected standards of work and behaviour. It may apply to individuals, groups or whole classes. Written Praise Should be used where appropriate to reinforce expected standards of work, reflecting the content of the Skills and Attributes and the school Marking Policy. Rewards: Pluses for Lower and Middle School Are awarded for all aspects of good work and behaviour in line with the Key Skills and Attributes, inside the classroom and beyond. They are recorded in the pupils’ planners, and by the form tutor on the database. Each time a pupil reaches 25, 50, 75 etc pluses they meet the Head, to receive a Scooby and a reward and an e-mail is sent to their parents/guardian to acknowledge the achievement. Only one plus should be awarded at a time. Rewards: College Coffee Points in Upper School Every pupil in Upper School is issued with a College Coffee Point card. Particularly good effort, work or behaviour in any facet of Prep life will attract a point from a member of staff. Teachers stamp and initial the card and once they have gained ten points, the Head countersigns and stamps the card. This can then be taken to College Coffee opposite the Sports Hall and can be traded in for a range of food or drinks from a selected menu. House and Section Commendations These are for non-academic and academic excellence respectively and will be awarded in the House and Section assemblies. They sit between a plus and a Head's Commendation and act as an extra reward to aim for. Head’s Commendation Any outstanding piece of work or act of kindness can be rewarded with a Head’s Commendation. Staff will recommend that an outstanding piece of work be put forward for a Commendation. Sanctions: Unacceptable Behaviour The most effective discipline is delivered by staff at the time of the offence, however minor. To ignore this is to condone poor behaviour and to allow the possibility of escalation. For example, to ignore running in an area where it is not appropriate, is to risk the same offence being committed and the outcome more difficult to deal with e.g. running and inadvertently colliding with and hurting a younger and/or smaller child. Sanctions are simple and in most cases will be a verbal reprimand, or the removal of free time. Whilst the school always aims in the first instance to promote a culture of positive discipline, the system outlined below pertains to the unacceptable behaviour of pupils. It is designed to be incremental, not a ‘one size fits all’ approach. To this end, staff may use some or all of the sanctions available depending on the behaviour displayed and whether this is a part of pattern or simply a one-off incident. When considering a potential sanction, staff will factor in a pupil’s age as well as considering any possible imbalance ofpower between two young people, such as physical strength, access to embarrassing information, popularity if any of"}

When considering a potential sanction, staff will factor in a pupil’s age as well as considering any possible imbalance ofpower between two young people, such as physical strength, access to embarrassing information, popularity if any of these are used to control or harm others. Power imbalances can change over time and in different situations, even if they involve the same people. The various sanctions available include: - Sanctions in Lower School Lower School sanctions are categorised as a ‘consequence’ and pupils in Year 3 and Year 4. Every inappropriate or negative action will lead to an appropriate consequence, which matches the severity of the action. Consequences will be logged on iSams to ensure there is a record. If necessary, parents will be contacted to inform them of their child’s actions. If a pupil consistently receives consequences or for actions that are deemed to be more serious, the Head of Section will meet with the pupil to discuss how behaviour can be improved. Sanctions in Middle and Upper Schools A Minus is issued to pupils for low-level misdemeanours following an initial warning from the member of staff and should in all instances be accompanied by a clear rebuke from the member of staff. Unacceptable behaviour that warrants a minus includes the following: persistent calling out, distracting others, persistent untidy appearance, poor attitude (this is an illustrative rather than an exhaustive list). A Minus is recorded on the database by the awarding staff member. A Minus does not result in a sanction per se and it may very well be the case that minuses help to identify an issue (in terms of organisation or punctuality for example), where staff support is more appropriate than an automatic sanction. The cumulative nature of the minus system gives pupils every opportunity to learn from previous mistakes but they must also be prepared to take responsibility for their actions. 4 minuses in one term Pupil meets with Head of Section Parents informed. Form Taker and Head of Section will sit down with the pupil and take time to look at the types of sanctions given and coach them with a way to avoid the same issues arising again. 6 minuses in one term Pupil meets with Senior Deputy Head Deputy Head Detention and Parents informed by Head of Section. 9 minuses in one term Second meeting with Senior Deputy Head Second Deputy Head Detention and Senior Deputy Head contacts pupil’s parents to discuss next steps After the end of each term, pupils’ minus tally reverts to zero, but the information on the database is retained. More serious misdemeanours will be escalated to the Head of Section and where necessary the Senior Deputy Head. Allegations of bullying will be investigated by Heads of Sections initially to establish the facts. Any incidents will also be discussed at the weekly meetings between Deputy Head Pastoral, Head of Section and the Senior Deputy Head; if bullying has occurred, it will assigned a level, in accordance with the Anti-Bullying Policy. Sanctions will frequently include a loss of free time or a community-based act of reparation, for example the returning of lost property, or helping to tidy class or changing rooms, in conjunction with an apology to the relevant individual. Any such incidents will be written up and recorded on CPOMS by the relevant person and the key information will be disseminated to form takers and Heads of Section as appropriate. The Prep will consider behaviour such as a tendency to physical abuse of others that is part of a disability (such as an autistic child who lashes out at care staff) to ensure that a disabled pupil is not put at a substantial disadvantage. Reasonable adjustments will be made eg de-escalation strategies, supervision, staff training. Prohibited items • Although not an exhaustive list, the following are not"}

Prohibited items • Although not an exhaustive list, the following are not allowed in school: • Alcohol • Vapes • Drugs • Knives • Blades • Cigarettes • Lighters A positive approach to negative behaviour It is important that the school has a range of options to support pupils in improving their behaviour and The Prep recognises that punitive solutions will in many cases be inappropriate and only serve to address the manifestation of the problem, rather than working with the pupil to resolve the issue that sits beneath the behaviour. Other strategies frequently used by the school include: Focus Report A Focus Report is drawn up by a Form Taker in consultation with the pupil following negative feedback from other staff. Specific targets for improving behaviour are drawn up, and the card is signed by each individual subject teacher each day for a week. If a child has received a Deputy Head detention, they will also receive a focus card for one week following the sanction. They will meet with the SDH to discuss their behaviour during that week and be signed off should the SDH be happy with their behaviour. Wider Pastoral Support Strategies When wider problems are identified through staff observation and / or parental feedback, a range of options is available to the school. These will usually involve working closely with parents and may include: • Chill and Chat small-sided group work • Intervention and follow up work with the Head of Section, Head of Wellbeing or Deputy Head (Pastoral) • Restorative meetings whereby those who have been harmed convey the impact of the harm to those responsible, and for those responsible to acknowledge this impact and take steps to put it right • Assistance of Pupil Support Services within the school using our child and adolescent psychotherapists Please refer to the Exclusion Policy for details of other sanctions and courses of actions for more serious issues. This policy can be obtained from the School Office. Rewards and Sanctions: Pre-Prep including EYFS General Principles In Pre-Prep, children are encouraged to think about their behaviour according to the following six Golden Rules. These rules are reinforced in every class and through many routines of the day including assemblies and PHSCE lessons. (PSED in EYFS) Praise and encouragement in lessons and around Pre-Prep is used as much as possible by all members of staff as it is generally recognized that this encourages positive behaviour. In Pre-Prep we will always look to promote positive discipline and reward the good that pupils do, rather than using sanctions; corporal punishment is never used or threatened. The Golden Rules • We are gentle…We don’t hurt others • We are honest….We don’t cover up the truth • We listen…We don’t interrupt • We are kind and helpful…. We don’t hurt anybody’s feelings • We look after property…. We don’t damage things • We work hard… We don’t waste time. Alongside the Golden Rules which are used to emphasise positive behaviour, Pre-Prep will encourage children to develop their Key Skills and Attributes. In Pre-Prep, these will be called Learning Powers. Each power is given a character with which the children can identify and these will be represented on stickers and stamps and awarded as appropriate. Ella the empathetic elephant Charlie the challenging cheetah Billy the bounce – back bunny (for resilience) Poppy the persevering pony Catherine the creative cat Peter the participating penguin Rewards In order to make The Prep work as happily and smoothly as possible: • Super Skills Squad Awards (rewards for Pre-Prep children which are handed out in assembly by the Head) • Good behaviour, effort and academic achievements should be rewarded as"}

Sanctions: Unacceptable behaviour If staff feels a child is not behaving appropriately, they will be spoken to by the Class Teacher who will ensure that the child understands what needs to change. The Golden Rules are used as a basis for this discussion. Pre-Prep staff will encourage a child to take responsibility for their behaviour and discuss with them how to make the best choice. They will also discuss the consequences and outcomes of the behaviour choices made by the child. On the rare occasions that a child does not change their behaviour or for a more serious incident, they will speak directly with the Head of Pre-Prep. Throughout Pre-Prep, all responses to children’s behaviour are based very much on their age. In Years 1 and 2, children will, after a warning, lose some of their Golden Time (a time when children get to choose from a range of possible activities as a reward for good behaviour) if their behaviour continues to be unacceptable. Patterns of deteriorating behaviour will result in a discussion between the Class Teacher and the parents. This may result in using sticker charts and behaviour monitoring on a session-by-session or daily basis, with verbal reporting to parents at the end of the day. The Head of Pre-Prep will be informed. Physical intervention is only allowable to avert immediate danger of an injury to a child. Should this occur, the incident should be reported to the Head of Pre-Prep, reported on the database and reported to the parents at the end of the day with relevant staff informed. Pastoral support in Pre-Prep If pastoral support is needed due to the identification of wider issues, then the Head of Pre-Prep will agree a plan with the child and parents. This plan will be monitored and the child observed for a period of time and then reviewed. Additional support offered may include: Chill and Chat with one of the pastoral leads within Pre-Prep. Playtime intervention and support by duty staff. Assistance of Pupil Support Services within the school. In Pre-Prep children can also access with play therapy, to support their emotional development and processing of events in school and in their wider lives. This helps to develop positive behaviour strategies and further builds upon the golden rules for treatment of self and others. Play Therapy is delivered by the school's child phycologist. Uniform and Jewellery All members of The Prep are expected to be tidily dressed at all times. Members of The Prep should be in Prep uniform, or, if involved in games, Prep games kit, until their session is finished. Tracksuits should be worn on top of games kit whenever pupils are in school. Uniform clothing must be in accordance with current clothing lists, except for the relaxations included below: Casual Clothes Casual clothes should always be clean, in good repair and appropriate to the occasion when they are worn. Casual clothes may be worn on days stipulated by The Prep, such as a nominated charity day or a trip to the theatre. Boarders may wear their casual"}

It should not cover the eyes or, in the case of boys, extend on to the collar. • Pony or rats' tail or a closely shaven head (#2 or lower), are not permitted. • Boys' hair should be the same length at the back and sides and graded rather than undercut. • Roots should be the same colour as the rest of a pupil's hair. • Pupils should not cut their own or other pupils' hair. • Girls’ hair should be tied up if it falls below the collar line. • Girls’ hair ties should be in school colours. Should the school deem that a pupil’s haircut is in breach of the rules above, The Prep will contact the pupil’s parents so that it can be remedied by a hairdresser at the earliest opportunity."}

Introduction 1.1 Cheltenham College will ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that first aid arrangements will be managed in compliance with the Health and Safety (First Aid) Regulations 1981. These first aid arrangements provide for training and re-training of first aiders, provision of first aid equipment and facilities and for the recording of first aid given. Arrangements will be such that first aid may be offered to employees, pupils, visitors, contractors, and others who may be affected by our activities. This policy takes account of the DfE ‘Guidance on First Aid for Schools’ Feb 2022 and the Statutory Framework for EYFS September 2021. In EYFS a number of practitioners are trained in Paediatric First Aid to ensure that there is always a qualified practitioner available when EYFS children are on and off site. Training is given by qualified instructors and updated every 3 years. If a child in EYFS receives first aid, a written record is kept, and parents informed on the same day or as soon as reasonably practicable. In the event of a child in EYFS suffering a serious accident, injury or death, local child protection agencies will be consulted. 1.2 First Aid means the treatment of minor injuries which do not need treatment by a medical practitioner or nurse as well as treatment of more serious injuries prior to assistance from medical practitioner or nurse for the purpose of preserving life and minimising the consequences of injury or illness. First Aid does not include giving any tablets or medicines. 1.3 Nothing in this policy should affect the ability of any person to contact the emergency services in the event of a medical emergency. For the avoidance of doubt, staff should dial 999 for the emergency services in the event of a medical emergency before implementing the terms of this Policy and make clear arrangements for liaison with ambulance services on the School site. 1.4 Cheltenham College will: a) Ensure compliance with relevant legislation b) Undertake sufficient assessments of first aid needs 2 c) Identify and implement reasonably practicable arrangements for dealing with accidents or incidents requiring provision of first aid d) Provide competent persons for carrying our first aid treatment e) Conduct regular checks on first aid equipment and the availability of consumables 1.5 Health Centre nurses will be the Appointed Person for First Aid for pupils, and if they are not on site the role is performed by designated First Aiders .The Lead Nurse will ensure that suitable equipment, facilities and consumables are provided for first aid treatment. Cheltenham College’s Health Centre will provide a first aid service during term time, including the ability for the duty nurse to attend incidents around site subject to Health Centre staffing and in- patient demands. Cheltenham College also undertakes to ensure that trained first aiders are provided at suitable locations to enable first aid to be administered without delay during all normal working times, including academic vacation periods. 1.6 Those who are externally employed to provide first aid cover at fixtures are done so in line with Cheltenham College’s safeguarding procedures. 1.7 Cheltenham College provide a number of Automated External Defibrillators (AED) defibrillator devices in suitable locations around the school so that they can be easily obtained in the event of cardiac arrest or circulatory collapse. They are located at the following sites: 1. Outside College Office in corridor off Quad 2. Health Centre 3. Cheltenham Prep school on the wall outside the Admissions Office ground floor 4.

If a pupil is injured and requires emergency First Aid it is better that a staff member does what they can to help, whilst calling for emergency help, than to do nothing. Staff will use their best endeavours, to secure the welfare of pupils and others. The consequence of taking no action is likely to be more serious than trying to assist. 1.9 In emergency situations, proportionate physical contact may be appropriate to administer first aid, as stipulated in Cheltenham College’s Restraint and Reasonable Force policy. 1.10 The main duties of First Aiders are to give immediate first aid to pupils, staff or visitors when needed and to ensure that an ambulance or other professional medical help is called when necessary. 1.11 If First Aid treatment is required it should be recorded using the College’s accident procedure. 1.12 Cheltenham College provides training and refresher training of first aiders. The Health, Safety and Risk Manager coordinate’s first aid training records and arranges for refresher courses and training of 3 additional or new staff to ensure adequate levels of training are maintained. Suitably qualified trainers provide the training. College has a member of staff qualified to deliver First Aid training. 1.13 First aid kits are provided in all Cheltenham College vehicles used for transporting pupils. It is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that the contents of the first aid box checks with the contents list attached within the box. Drivers using items from the first aid box should seek replacements from the Health Centre before signing off the vehicle. 1.14 First aid kits are provided for all buildings and departments, under the management of the Head of Department, and re-stocking overseen by the Health Centre Team (please refer to Appendix 1) 1.15 Cheltenham College’s Health Centre is the nominated First Aid Room during term time. Outside term time the Sports Centre’s First Aid Room is the nominated First Aid Room. 2. Responsibilities 2.1 All staff have the following responsibilities: a) To report accidents, no matter how minor, or incidents that might have resulted in an accident. b) To co-operate with any member of qualified first aid staff in fulfilling their duties, and when completing an accident report form. c) To consider strongly following any advice given to them by a member of the Health Centre staff or a First Aider, such as visiting a hospital, checking with a doctor, or resting in the Health Centre, at home or the Boarding House for a period of time. 2.2 Teachers and other staff in charge of pupils are expected to use their best endeavours, particularly in emergencies, to secure the welfare of the pupils in the same way that parents might be expected to act towards their children. In general, the consequences of taking no action are likely to be more serious than those of trying to assist in an emergency. 3. Arrangements 3.1 The person who is present should assess the situation and decide on the next course of action, which may involve immediately calling for an ambulance. The Health Centre should be informed as soon as possible. First aiders can also be called if necessary and should be called if a School Nurse is not immediately available. However minor the injury, the Health Centre should always be informed. 3.2 Cheltenham College Health Centre is staffed by qualified nurses, on duty in the Health Centre during the working day,"}

Accident Reporting Forms are available on the Health and Safety Portal on Digizone. 5 3.11 The Health, Safety and Risk Manager is responsible for reporting any incident which is reportable under RIDDOR (Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013). 3.12 The College maintains a risk assessment system that considers accident reports to determine whether current controls and precautions are adequate and appropriate. 3.13 If someone at Cheltenham College has an accident whilst around the Cheltenham College site which requires first aid, staff are to summon medical help immediately from the Health Centre. 4. Calling an ambulance 4.1 Health Centre nurses are normally responsible for summoning an ambulance if required. Pupils are escorted to hospital by the House Matron.

Where reasonable force is used the Deputy Head (Pastoral) must be informed and it will be recorded in writing. LINK: Restraint and Reasonable Force Policy 14. Safe Use of Ice Packs for Treating Injuries and Swelling Leaving an ice pack (i.e. ice pack taken from freezer compartment) on an injury for too long, or in direct contact with the skin, can cause Frostnip or Frostbite. The intense cold from the Ice Pack can cause burns which damage the upper layers of the skin (frostbite) and require burns treatment or skin grafts. Symptoms A person suffering from Frostnip/Frostbite may experience the following symptoms: 1. The intense cold feeling where the ice pack contacts the skin 2. A burning or tingling sensation 3. Reddened or pale skin 4. Blue, white, grey or waxy skin, with swelling and skin blisters 5. The area starts to ache 6. Numbness – if numbness is experienced the ice pack must be removed immediately If someone has symptoms of frostbite, seek medical help immediately. Preventing Frostnip/Frostbite burns; 1.

Record Keeping and Monitoring 14.1 Cheltenham College maintains a record of all accidents and injuries and reviews these regularly in order, where possible, to minimize the likelihood or recurrence. Records are kept of all visits to the Health Centre. 14.2 The Health and Safety Committee will organise a regular review of the Cheltenham College Accident Record to review Cheltenham College’s systems and management of medical welfare and any trends in accidents, injuries and illnesses at Cheltenham College in order to identify whether a review or change in welfare practice is needed. This will also form part of the First Aid risk assessment process. In addition, the Deputy Head (Pastoral) or a senior member of staff will undertake a review of all procedures following any major incident to check whether the procedures were sufficiently robust to deal with the major occurrence or whether improvements should be made. 16. Reporting 16.1 Reporting to Parents: In the event of serious accident or injury parents or guardian(s) must be informed as soon as practicable.

In the event of a more serious injury, the Health Centre will be informed immediately, and a Nurse will come to assess the situation and engage further help where necessary.

Using a mobile phone to call where a landline is not near to the patient will avoid any undue delay. This is important for a variety of reasons, if the call is about an illness the call Emergency Medical Dispatcher (EMD) may want to know if there is a rash, what their breathing sounds like, any rapid swelling of the lip, face, throat, or tongue, does their skin a feel normal temperature etc. If the call is about an injury the EMD may ask questions like, is the limb cold, pale, or blue, can the patient weight-bear, are there any pins and needles in the limb, any bleeding etc. This will also enable any life saving instructions to be relayed prior to the arrival of ambulance clinicians. When you first ring 999 you will be put through to an emergency operator who will ask which service you require (Police, Fire, Ambulance). The BT Emergency Operator will then connect you to an Emergency Medical Dispatcher (EMD) at the Ambulance Service, whose role is outlined below. The South Western Ambulance Service uses a triage tool called Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS), which establishes a universal standard for EMD’s taking emergency 999 calls based on the signs and symptoms reported by the caller. Calls are prioritised so that patients with life threatening conditions receive the fastest and most appropriate response. The ambulances are only sent on blue lights and sirens to the most serious conditions, thus minimizing the risk to other road users and the wider public. When you are connected to the ambulance service, the EMD will immediately begin to gather information, following the steps below. • You will be asked two pre-triage questions, Is the patient breathing? and Is the patient awake? If the patient is not breathing, you will not be asked if the patient is awake. If the patient is not awake, you will be asked Does their breathing sound noisy? • You will then be asked Okay, Tell me exactly what has happened? at this point the ambulance service will only want to know a brief summary of what is happening/has happened. i.e. “they have injured their ankle playing football”, “they have breathing difficulties” etc. 17 • You will then be asked to confirm the address of the emergency including a contact telephone number just in case you get cut off and the EMD can call you back. These may be requested a second time to confirm that have been correctly recorded. • The call will then be triaged, based on the description of events described. For this to be done more effectively the EMD will need to speak with the patient or someone who is with the patient. • The EMD will carry out a safe effective assessment of the symptoms reported, as the clinical assessment progresses each answer determines the next question to be asked. • Instructions on how to manage the patient will be given by the EMD, in response to the symptoms presented. These may include simple wound care, patient positioning or even CPR instructions. An ambulance may be physically dispatched at any point in the process, so there is not necessarily a delay by having to answer more questions. Obviously, these questions will vary depending on the symptoms and condition of the patient, it does therefore require the patient or someone with the patient to answer these questions, to enable the call to be prioritised most appropriately. Not all incidents will require an ambulance to attend. Following the assessment, you may be asked if the school or the parents are able to transport the patient to hospital, Doctors surgery, Minor Injury unit or to contact the NHS111 service or await a call back from an Ambulance Service Clinician. Remember: •"}

Remember: • If, when asked is the patient breathing, you answer no, this could potentially be a life- threatening emergency and an ambulance will be dispatched immediately or even diverted from a lower priority emergency call. • If deemed necessary, the EMD will ask you if someone is able to get a defibrillator if one is available and may give you the location of the nearest Community Public Access Defibrillator (CPAD). • The EMD will talk you through what you can do to help, such as providing instructions on how to perform Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). This requires a phone to be next to the patient and ideally on loudspeaker. You will be asked to shout out the chest compressions as you give them, so the EMD knows what is happening. If there is more than one person able to perform CPR, please remember to swap as it will be very tiring. • Do not stop resuscitation when paramedics arrive, as they will require a few seconds to gather and assemble their equipment. They will let you know when they are ready to take over. • Where possible, it is important for someone to meet and direct the ambulance crew, as this may assist them in getting to the patient quicker."}

Introduction 1.1 This policy applies to all pupils at Cheltenham College irrespective of their age and whether or not a pupil is in the care of the College when or if bullying behaviour occurs. This policy provides guidance for all pupils, staff and parents about recognising bullying and what to do if a bullying incident occurs. 1.2 This policy has been drawn up with assistance from the guidance issued by the DfE Preventing and Tackling Bullying (July 2017) as well as the NSPCC guidance and will be reviewed against subsequent government guidance issued from time to time. 1.3 A copy of this policy is available on the College website and upon request from the Bursar’s PA and should be read in conjunction with the College's: • Child Protection and Safeguarding Policy; • Child on Child Abuse Policy. • E-Safety and Acceptable Use of ICT Policy; • Behaviour Policy • Rewards and Sanctions Policy; • Keeping Children Safe in Education 2023 • A pupil’s Guide to Dealing with Bullying & Cyber-bullying 1.4 Pupils, staff and parents should also see the supplementary advice documents and other helpful resources listed throughout this policy. 1.5 The ‘Pupil Guidance’ in this policy was discussed and agreed by the College Student Council in October 2024 2. Aim 2.1 The ultimate aim of the College Anti-Bullying policy is to create a culture in College that ensures that everyone can operate in a supportive, caring and safe environment without the fear of being bullied. All members of the community, including Council, teaching and non-teaching staff, pupils and parents should have an understanding of what bullying is and be familiar with the College policy on bullying. Bullying is an anti-social behaviour, which affects everyone; it is unacceptable and it will not be tolerated. 2.2 Everyone in the community has a responsibility to report any incident of bullying that comes to their attention and these reports will always be taken seriously. Reporting bullying so it can be addressed is especially important within boarding schools like College; boarders who are being bullied (off line) cannot escape their bullies during term time in the same way that pupils in a day school are able to. Only when all issues of bullying are addressed will our pupils be able to fully benefit from the opportunities available at College. College operates a “Say you’re in , Call it out Campaign” and all pupils are made aware of our Cheltonian Charter through ‘Values Assemblies’. The latter document is written by College Prefects. The aim of both is to encourage a culture of kindness and tolerance, focusing on an individual’s responsibility to regulate their own behaviours and those of their peer group. 3. Definition 3.1 Bullying may be defined as any behaviour by an individual or a group that is deliberately hurtful either physically or emotionally, usually (but not exclusively) repeated over a period of time, where it is difficult for those being bullied to defend themselves. It is often motivated by prejudice against particular groups, for example, on grounds of race, religion, culture, sex, gender, homophobia, special educational needs and disability, or because a child is adopted or is a carer – it may occur directly or through cyber-technology (social websites, mobile phones, text messages, photographs and email). Often the bully or bullies hold more power than those being bullied. This may be down to differences in age, or other factors that cause a power imbalance. This imbalance of power can manifest itself in several ways, physical, psychological (knowing what upsets someone), derive from an intellectual imbalance, or by having access to the support of a group, or the capacity to socially isolate. It can result in the intimidation of a person or persons through the threat of violence or by isolating them either physically or online. All staff should be aware that children can abuse other children (child on child abuse) and bullying, specifically when it involves hitting, kicking, shaking, biting, hair pulling, or otherwise causing physical harm should be treated as a safeguarding issue. Examples of unacceptable behaviour include: a)"}

All staff should be aware that children can abuse other children (child on child abuse) and bullying, specifically when it involves hitting, kicking, shaking, biting, hair pulling, or otherwise causing physical harm should be treated as a safeguarding issue. Examples of unacceptable behaviour include: a) Physical (including sexual) behaviour. For example, hitting, kicking, pushing, spitting, removing belongings, damaging property, touching someone in an inappropriate or sexually inappropriate way. b) Verbal abuse, by name calling, taunting, mocking, teasing, insulting (including sexually inappropriate comments), writing notes, making offensive remarks or spreading malicious gossip. c) Attacking property, by stealing or hiding or vandalising someone's possessions. d) Cyber-bullying, which is defined as the use of technology by an individual or group to support deliberate, repeated and hostile behaviour intended to harm others. A single event may be considered cyber-bullying depending on the circumstances and impact on the victim. Examples include: inappropriate text messaging or emailing, sending offensive or inappropriate images by text, social media or email, and the use of ‘Deep Fake’ AI generated imagery to humiliate or malign. e) indirect emotional tormenting by excluding from social groups, gossiping or spreading hurtful or untrue rumours, initiation (hazing) ceremonies intended or likely to cause pain, anxiety or humiliation. f) persistent or unwelcome contact, whether physical, verbal, or online. g) bullying related to coercive, controlling behaviour within a relationship. h) bullying in intimate relationships leading to sexual harassment, sharing of consensual and non-consensual sharing of nudes and semi-nude images, as well as sexual activity such as upskirting, down-blousing or cyber flashing. 3.2 Protected Characteristics: Bullying may involve complicity that falls short of direct participation by, for instance, manipulating a third party to tease or torment someone. It may be overt and intimidatory but is often hidden and subtle. It includes actions or comments that fall under the protected characteristics (although bullying is not limited to these), pertaining to a pupil’s: • sex • race • disability • religion or belief • sexual orientation • gender reassignment • pregnancy and maternity 3.3 Prejudice based bullying: Prejudice based bullying is repeated hurtful behaviour that exploits or abuses someone based on their actual or supposed membership of a vulnerable group or their support for such a group. The protected characteristics identified in the Equality Act 2010 (as set out above) are particularly relevant in this context Staff should be particularly vigilant around bullying that could be: • Bullying related to race, religion, belief or culture; (see Prevent Policy) • Bullying related to special educational needs (SEND), learning difficulties or disabilities or health conditions; • Bullying related to personal appearance or body shape; • Bullying related to sexual orientation; • Bullying related to pregnancy and maternity; • Bullying of young carers or looked after children or adopted children or otherwise related to home circumstances; • Bullying related to a person's gender or gender reassignment. • Bullying in the form of unwanted sexual behaviour. 3.4 The seriousness of bullying cannot be over-emphasised. Bullying is a form of emotional abuse, especially if it causes them to feel frightened or in danger. Bullying is among the top concerns that parents have about their children’s safety and well-being at, and on the way to and from, school. Bullying is also a top concern of children and young people themselves. Bullying makes the lives of its victims a misery: it undermines their confidence and self-esteem and destroys their sense of security. Bullying impacts on its victims’ attendance and attainment at school; marginalises those individuals or groups who may be particular targets for bullies and can have a life-long negative impact on some young people’s lives. At worst, bullying can be a factor in pupil suicide. Children with specific vulnerabilities such as special educational needs and disabilities are more likely to be a victim of bullying. All staff should take this into consideration when dealing with incidents of bullying. Pupils of"}

At worst, bullying can be a factor in pupil suicide. Children with specific vulnerabilities such as special educational needs and disabilities are more likely to be a victim of bullying. All staff should take this into consideration when dealing with incidents of bullying. Pupils of Concern List is circulated to staff on a regular basis. This list highlights pupils who may be vulnerable because of specific individual circumstances. 3.5 It is acknowledged that bullies may have complex reasons for their behaviour and may well also need help. It should also be recognised that the consequences of being allowed to ‘get away with it’ can be detrimental to them as well as to their victim. All pupils deserve the opportunity to be helped to understand what acceptable behaviour is. There are criminal laws that apply to harassment, assault, distribution of inappropriate images and threatening behaviour. 3.6 Bullying becomes a child protection matter when it causes or poses a risk of significant harm to a child, particularly when it involves physical violence, coercion, emotional abuse, or persistent, targeted behaviours that impact a child’s wellbeing or development. Under the Children Act 1989, local authorities have a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, and the Education Act 2002 places a statutory responsibility on schools to do the same. When bullying meets the threshold for abuse, it is addressed in line with our Child-on-Child Abuse Policy, which recognises that harmful behaviour between children can constitute abuse and must be responded to accordingly. The school will assess the situation, and if necessary, take advice from the Community Social Work. If the threshold is reached a make a referral will be made to Gloucestershire’s Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH). Support for the child will also be structured using the Gloucestershire Graduated Pathway, including tools such as My Plan or My Plan+, to ensure a coordinated, multi-agency approach tailored to the child's individual needs. 4. What to look for 4.1 Pupils who are being bullied may show changes in behaviour, such as becoming shy and nervous, feigning illness, taking unusual absences or clinging to adults. There may be evidence of changes in work patterns, lacking concentration or truanting from school. All members of the community must be alert to the signs of bullying and act promptly and firmly against it, in accordance with College policy. Surveys have shown that in the vast majority of bullying incidents, MOST people knew that what was going on was wrong. Sometimes people, either through lethargy, peer group pressure, or tacit support for what is going on, fail to take action. 5. What to do The way to combat bullying is for people to be aware of the issues involved, and to be clear in their own minds what action to take should concerns arise: 5.1 If you are the victim: 5.1.1 If you feel able to, confront the bully by verbally making him/her aware that you think that what he/she is doing is wrong. Do not respond physically. Bullies want to upset you; if you respond calmly and even with humour, they will see little point in trying again. 5.1.2 Share your feelings with someone else. Ideally, talk to any member of staff such as your Tutor or Housemaster/Housemistress. You can also talk to the Director of Pupil Welfare or with our Student Support Services by emailing sss@cheltenhamcollege.org. If you would rather not go straight to a member of staff, talk to your friends; talk to a senior pupil, a Peer Mentor or one of the Prefects. They may well be able to advise on an appropriate course of action or will be able to involve other people who can. Make use of the option to be able to tell your HsM discreetly by using the “I think you should know” box in your House. Tell your parents or another family member. Do remember to"}

Make use of the option to be able to tell your HsM discreetly by using the “I think you should know” box in your House. Tell your parents or another family member. Do remember to say something. If you really feel unable to speak to anybody in College then you can use the anonymous reporting tool “Whisper” by clicking on the following link https://swgfl.org.uk/whisper/chc1/ 5.1.3 There are also people outside the College who would be willing to help. Details of organisations who may be able to help include: • Childline: 0800 1111 or www.childline.org.uk • Kidscape: www.kidscape.org.uk; • NSPCC: www.nspcc.org.uk; • Anti-bullying Alliance: www.anti-bullyingalliance.org.uk • Young Minds: www.youngminds.org.uk • Family Lives: www.familylives.org.uk • Samaritans: www.samaritans.org 5.2 If you are a pupil and you witness bullying behaviour: 5.2.1 Do not, do nothing. Support the victim by offering your friendship and make it clear that in your opinion what is happening to them is wrong. Encourage them to speak out on their own behalf by confronting the bully, or with their permission, confront the bully yourself. 5.2.2 Take the victim to a trusted adult as described above and reassure them that doing something will make a positive difference, or suggest that you see someone on their behalf. 5.2.3 All pupils in College are encouraged to read the “A Pupil’s Guide to Dealing with Bullying & Cyberbullying” notice in Houses and the “Worried about things” notice which are displayed in houses. 5.3 If you are a member of Staff and you witness an incident of bullying or it is reported to you: 5.3.1 Reassure and support the pupils involved. Advise them that you are required to pass details on to the relevant member of the pastoral team: Housemaster/Housemistress (HsM), Assistant Head Pastoral (AHP), The DSL and the Senior HsM. Staff should refer using CPOMS by ticking the bullying category. This should be done as soon as possible. 5.3.2 This person will record all incidents of reported bullying. At College the Incident Report must be completed on CPOMs These reports are reviewed regularly by the AHP, DSL and SDH. A central log of all complaints or incidences of bullying with be recorded on CPOMs and a list head by AHP/SDH. Follow up dates will be recorded on the incident record as an action. The initial follow up must occur within 2 weeks of the incident, or sooner if necessary. 5.3.4 Where there is reasonable cause to suspect that a child is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm, a bullying incident should be addressed as a child protection concern. Staff should immediately discuss the issue with the DSL or deputy DSLs in this situation. If there is immediate concern for the safety of a child, staff can make appropriate physical contact to control or restrain a pupil. 5.3.5 College reserves the right to contact the police if an offence may have been committed under the Malicious Communications Act 1988. 5.3.6 Low level disruption should be challenged. Early intervention can help to set clear expectations of the behaviour that is and isn't acceptable and help stop negative behaviour escalating. This may be recorded as a level 0. 5.4 Bullying Levels and what will happen: The levels below are guidance to assess the school’s response to incidents of peer on peer harmful behaviour. Contextual factors will always be taken into account. Level 0 (Stage 0) Thoughtlessness: Whether on-line or in person, if a pupil has made comments that are unkind and hurtful, but are considered to be clearly thoughtless the HsM may have a conversation with the pupil about the impact of their behaviour. They may be asked to complete a ‘Think about it’ memo and could be placed in detention to write reflective essays. This conversation would be recorded by the HsM. The Senior Hsm should be consulted to"}

They may be asked to complete a ‘Think about it’ memo and could be placed in detention to write reflective essays. This conversation would be recorded by the HsM. The Senior Hsm should be consulted to ensure consistency of Level 0 across Houses. It is likely parents would be contacted by their Hsm. Level 1 (Stage 1) Whether on-line or in person, where there is a degree of repetition, or where thoughtless behaviour involves physicality, or if there is an imbalance of power such as where the victim is a vulnerable pupil, or where the bullying is across different year groups. At Level 1 it is likely to involve a Senior Hsm Gating and parents will be informed in writing by the Senior Hsm or Hsm depending upon circumstances. This stage may be by-passed and sanctions imposed immediately if bullying is found to be more serious. Should a pupil accumulate several L1 sanctions that are related to different pupils a more significant sanction is likely to be issued. Level 2 (Stage 2) Warning as to future conduct: If, after the above discussion, the bullying continues, it will be assumed it is deliberate, and a more severe approach will need to be taken. If an individual incident of bullying is deemed serious enough, this may also warrant a `Level 2 intervention.’ Sanctions will depend on the severity of the bullying. Following HsMs discussion with Senior HsM and Assistant Head Pastoral a formal letter will be sent to parents. A meeting with parents and AHP may be necessary. Level 3 (Stage 3) If after these two stages the bullying continues, or in very serious individual cases where significant physical or emotional harm has been caused, it will be assumed that the pupil has no respect for other Cheltonians and this will not be tolerated within the school community. In this situation a meeting between parents and the Head to discuss a pupil’s position in the College community will be arranged. In very serious cases it may be necessary to make a report to the Police or Social Services. College reserves the right to act to address a pupil's conduct when s/he is not on school premises or under control of a College member of staff. This may include contacting outside agencies. The above levels are equally applicable for breaches of acceptable behaviour on-line Reparation: Where appropriate, reparation may be used in conjunction with any Level of Bullying. It offers a ‘no-blame’ approach to both parties. The victim(s) and their bully(ies) may have a discussion with a teacher who would normally be the HsM. This discussion allows both parties to give their opinions and to try to work out a solution which is mutually agreeable. The aim is to allow the bullies to realise that they are causing unhappiness and that their behaviour will not be tolerated. Everything in this discussion will be recorded in writing and filed. Following this, communication will be made with parents / guardians to let them know about the situation and what has been done. This will be confidential, although tutors should be made aware and an Incident should be uploaded to CPOMS. The HsM may want to inform House Prefects so that they can be vigilant. In all cases it is important that the “voice of the child” is heard and that their views are sought and recorded. A pupil may choose not to partake in the reparation process, for example. 5.5 Prevention: 5.5.1 The College will raise the awareness of all the staff through education and staff briefings which will ensure that staff responsibilities and the principles underpinning this policy are understood. This is done through staff Inset looking at issues such as child-on-child abuse, looking at issues surrounding pupils with SEND and issues surrounding LGBT+. 5.5.2 To raise greater awareness among"}

This is done through staff Inset looking at issues such as child-on-child abuse, looking at issues surrounding pupils with SEND and issues surrounding LGBT+. 5.5.2 To raise greater awareness among the pupils, the key points from this policy will be prominently displayed on College notice boards and will be discussed with pupils during Tutor led Floreat sessions. It will also be revisited as necessary during Floreat sessions to all years and reinforced in other areas of the curriculum and co-curriculum, as the opportunities present themselves. Differences between people are also referred to in Floreat, TPE and other subjects and both staff and pupils will be made aware of the inappropriateness of any type of discrimination. We encourage pupils to read and be familiar with ‘A pupil’s Guide to Dealing with Bullying & Cyber-bullying’. Anti-bullying will feature as a regular discussion point for Pupil Voice. House staff are encouraged to keep a special eye out for more vulnerable pupils who may be the victim of bullying and are likely to suffer more from any bullying. 5.5. Pupil surveys are used in order to facilitate an understanding of the level and type of bullying that pupils might have experienced. College also operates a Peer Mentors scheme whereby older pupils are encouraged to offer advice and support to younger pupils. Leadership training is provided to College and House Prefects, which specifically covers the importance of offering support and assistance to younger and vulnerable pupils. 5.5.4 The record of bullying offences is reviewed regularly by the respective AHP and DHP in order to identify trends and patterns and check that the policy is effective and introduce additional initiatives when necessary. Anti-Bullying is also a standing item on the whole school Pastoral Management Team (PMT) agenda. The PMT generally meets four times a term. 5.5.5 One of the most effective ways to prevent bullying is to celebrate difference and the successes of individuals in a variety of fields. 5.5.6 To encourage greater use of Whisper in order to report incidents of bullying, for example through assemblies and Floreat, as well as talking to parents about it at the start of term new parent information day. 5.6 Support and follow up A pupil who has been bullied will need support and the HsM will lead this support. This may involve more formal welfare plans or may just involve a HsM / tutor keeping an eye on the pupil. It may be appropriate for some victims, and in some cases perpetrators, to be placed on the WMT list and to receive support from SSS. Following a bullying incident at level 2, and where deemed appropriate at level I, a follow up meeting will be arranged with the victim to ensure that they feel satisfied with how the incident was handled, that their voice was heard and that there were no further repercussions. The outcome of this meeting should be recorded on House Bullying records and on CPOMS. 6. Information for Parents The following information may be helpful to parents and guardians in playing their part in the prevention of bullying: • Look for unusual behaviour in your child. For example, s/he may suddenly not want to attend school, feel ill regularly, or not complete work to their usual standard. • Ask how your child’s day has gone, who they have spent time with, what they did at lunchtime etc. • If you feel your child is being bullied, encourage your son or daughter to inform their Housemaster or Housemistress immediately. If they will not do so, then please do so yourself. Your concern will be taken seriously and appropriate action in accordance with this policy will follow. • It is important that you tell your child not to fight back. It can make matters worse! Where possible"}

Where possible encourage your child to take ownership of the issue themselves, and tell staff themselves. • Tell your child that there is nothing wrong with him or her. It is not his/her fault that they are being bullied. • Make sure your child is fully aware of this Anti-Bullying Policy, and that s/he should not be afraid to ask for help. • The DfE has published the following guidance document for parents: Advice for parents and carers on cyberbullying. It can be downloaded from www.gov.uk. 7. Prevention of Cyber-bullying The issue of Cyberbullying is one that the College takes seriously. In addition to the preventative measures described above, the College: • Expects all pupils to adhere to its ICT Acceptable Use Policy which they agree to on joining the College. Certain sites are blocked by our filtering system and the ICT Department monitors pupils’ use • May impose sanctions for the misuse or attempted misuse of the internet or e mail • Has a dedicated senior member of staff responsible for e-safety • Digital-safety talks are delivered on a regular basis on a rolling programme, offering guidance on the safe use of social networking sites, including keeping personal details safe • Cyber-bullying is covered in the 3rd Form Induction programme and in the Autumn term all 3rd Form Pupils sign up to a mutually agreed House charter. • Cyber-bullying is covered in Floreat sessions • Mobile phones are not permitted in classrooms or in the public areas of the College unless with the express permission of a teacher. • Lower College Pupils are not allowed mobile phones in College. • The use of cameras (including those on mobile phones) is not allowed in communal washing/ changing areas. In line with College’s ‘Search Policy’, a HsM may, with permission from and in conjunction with the SDH, confiscate and examine data or files on a pupil's electronic device if there are reasonable grounds to suspect a pupil has acted in a manner which may contravene this policy. The HsM may delete these files if there is good reason to do so. If there is evidence that an offence has been committed that image or file should not be deleted prior to the device being handed to the relevant authorities. If you are a victim of cyberbullying or if you come across harmful content about you online, there are different ways you can report a problem: • A national reporting centre (run by the UK Safer Internet Centre) designed to assist everyone in reporting harmful content online - https://reportharmfulcontent.com/ • Install button onto website for report harmful content site - https://reportharmfulcontent.com/advice/other/further-advice/downloads/ and Internet • Report Remove Tool - https://www.childline.org.uk/info-advice/bullying-abuse-safety/online-mobilesafety/remove-nude-image-shared-online/ References: Prevention and tackling of Bullying – DfE 2017 Education (Independent School Standards) Regulations 2014 National Minimum Standards for Boarding Schools 2022 www.cyberbullying.org Getting started: A toolkit for preventing and tackling homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying in secondary schools – Stonewall Equality Act 2010"}

Cheltenham College aspires to ensure that all EAL pupils are integrated fully into the College community. They experience an immersion technique through which they acquire English through their academic studies and through their social interaction with UK students, students of other nationalities and teachers in the classroom, in the boarding houses, on the sports pitch and in all of their everyday activities. Pastoral and academic staff all have a responsibility for supporting EAL students at Cheltenham College. There is an English as an Additional Language department with two members of staff available for further academic guidance and support, and the Director of Internationalism and Culture, who can be of further help with pastoral care. Admission to Cheltenham College Prospective pupils who do not have English as their first language may apply for a place at the school in the usual manner. Their assessment will include an online proficiency test and a written test of English language; this would either be the College paper with CAT4 and Oxford Placement Test, or the UKISET, which includes the Cambridge Placement Test. All forms of entry will be marked by the Head of EAL to check that students meet College’s language requirements. In the event that they visit the College, they may engage in an informal interview with the Head of EAL, or another appropriate member of staff. Alternatively, an interview may take place via Skype, if appropriate. The results of these English language tests may be added to those for other subjects, whether or not for Common Entrance, to determine whether the pupil would be able to cope with studying in a second language and thus, may be offered a place to study at College. Whilst every applicant is treated as an individual, we generally look for a minimum of a A2 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) for Third Form entry; B2 for Fourth Form entry; and B2 for Lower Sixth. Alongside this, pupils must complete a written paper and take the CAT4 test. EAL pupils who are admitted to College will be able to receive specialist help to enable them to access the mainstream curriculum. In addition, pupils may be prepared for English for Speakers of other Languages (ESOL) exams, where appropriate, such as the Cambridge English Language Assessment examinations and IELTS. The fee for entering these examinations is charged to the end-of-term bill. During new pupils’ early EAL lessons, further assessment, both overt and discreet, takes place. Subject teachers, tutors and House staff also monitor these pupils both in House and in the mainstream classroom. The Head of EAL may also carry out “shadowing” of new EAL pupils in order to better ascertain their English language needs in the mainstream classroom. Evidence of need for language support will lead to the drawing up of an EAL Learning Needs plan and to the pupil receiving group and/or individual EAL lessons. Link with Cheltenham Prep College enjoys close links with the EAL staff at Cheltenham Prep. Staff share good practice, resources and give advice both ways, in order to provide the best possible service for the pupils across both schools. Staff meet regularly to synchronise the admissions process, and share information about pupils moving up to College, in order to ease in the prospective pupil as seamlessly as possible. When a pupil is coming to College from the Prep school, staff will discuss and assess the level of support required for the pupil, based on their individual learning needs.

When a pupil is coming to College from the Prep school, staff will discuss and assess the level of support required for the pupil, based on their individual learning needs. Pastoral and Social Welfare In addition to receiving support for their language needs in the form of group and/or individual lessons, College aims to ensure that all EAL pupils feel included in the school community and cared for pastorally. All pupils at Cheltenham College have a Housemaster or Housemistress and Tutor who are responsible for their academic, pastoral and social welfare. The Head of EAL, other EAL teachers and the Tutor in charge of International Students are additional points of contact for pupils for whom English is not the first language. Every House has a Peer Mentor who is friendly and approachable to international students. Peer Mentors take special interest in international pupils and help with queries they may have. College therapists are available and offer confidential and professional support to any pupil. This service is free of charge up to a threshold; there is usually a charge for longer-term counselling and parents are consulted in such instances. College aims to ensure that all pupils, international or UK-based, will feel there is always someone they can turn to however small a perceived problem. Induction Course All EAL pupils are strongly encouraged to attend the International Induction, which takes place in the days immediately prior to the start of the Autumn Term. Parents/guardians are usually invited to an informal buffet meal that offers the opportunity to meet key staff. Library, ICT and inductions on English education are included in the course. In addition, students are taken on outings, and evening activities are organised to encourage social interaction. The new pupils are familiarised with College, its buildings, its timetable and its traditions, in a sheltered environment. Sessions are offered on linguistic issues such as coping with unknown vocabulary, note-taking and study skills, in preparation for the academic demands of the curriculum. The Academic Year Lower College pupils (Third, Fourth and Fifth Form) for whom English is an additional language and who are deemed to need support, have EAL lessons in year groups, normally when their peers are learning French, although on occasion this could be in place of another Modern Foreign Language. Third Form pupils receive three lessons and Fourth and Fifth Form pupils receive four lessons per week. Lower Sixth Form pupils may follow an EAL course, which leads to taking the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) examination in May or June, at a suitable examination centre. This examination is an internationally accepted university entrance qualification. The IELTS examination tests academic skills in listening, reading, writing and speaking. The examination is designed to grade pupils’ level of English at a level of 1.0 – 9.0. The grade needed depends on the individual university or course but most require an overall score of 6.5 – 7.5. Any EAL or International student with a GCSE English Language Level 6 or above (previously equivalent to Grade B or above) is not expected to attend IELTS preparation lessons, although it is still recommended in some cases for highly competitive courses. The Head of EAL is able to advise. Pupils attaining Level 5 or below are expected to attend IELTS preparation lessons with a view to take the exam in the summer term of Lower Sixth Form; this includes any Lower Sixth Form pupil who has not taken GCSEs. The Lower Sixth EAL course also addresses skills that are important for study in higher education. The pupils receive one reading and writing lesson and one speaking and listening lesson per week. There is a termly charge for the IELTS preparation course. Please see the schedule at the end of this document. One-to-one Lessons In addition to group lessons, pupils may receive one-to-one lessons and/or small group lessons, if a particular need is identified.

One-to-one Lessons In addition to group lessons, pupils may receive one-to-one lessons and/or small group lessons, if a particular need is identified. Each pupil is involved in planning his or her termly programme together with the Head of EAL or EAL teacher, informed by information provided by diagnostic testing and the professional judgement of the teacher. Work is regularly reviewed and together the teacher and pupil make suggestions and set targets for the term ahead. Pupils are committed for a term of one-to-one lessons at a time, so there is a chance for progress to be made and recognised. One-to-one lessons will focus on developing language skills in general, but also on any subject lexis that students find harder. There is a charge for one-to-one and small group tuition. Please see the schedule at the end of this document. Syllabuses The focus of lessons in the Third and Fourth Form is on enhancing the four skills: listening, reading, writing and speaking. The detail of lessons depends on any group’s particular needs, as identified through diagnostic testing. The department aims to support EAL pupils’ learning, not only in terms of language, but also of what the pupils are covering in other subjects, particularly to help with cultural context and subject vocabulary. Therefore, there is a strong cross-curricular aspect to lessons. Other lessons may be focussed on areas of grammar still needing more practice. The Fifth Form pupils, once again, follow lessons focusing on further developing the four skill areas and on perfecting more complex areas of grammar and improving written expression. The EAL department also keeps abreast of what is being studied in the mainstream English department so that further support can be given in EAL lessons where necessary. Time is also put aside to give extra focus to supervised revision for upcoming exams, as well as to look at ongoing coursework whilst keeping in mind the strict rules regarding coursework support / assistance. The Sixth Form IELTS syllabus focuses on developing the skills required for the IELTS examination such as listening for detail, reading academic texts and writing academic essays with balance, justification of points made and successful structure. There is much exam practice offered, ensuring that the pupils are adequately prepared for the examination. Examinations Together with the College Examinations Officer, the Head of EAL makes decisions about whether pupils are eligible for bilingual dictionary use, using rules laid down by the Joint Council for Qualifications. Bilingual dictionary usage is not allowed in Modern Foreign Language, English Language and English Literature GCSE, A-level or English language proficiency examinations. As entrants have demonstrated reasonable proficiency in using English for entry to College, they are not eligible for extra time in public examinations on the basis of English being an additional language. Only a pupil who has an identified specific learning difficulty in his/her own language may be considered for eligibility for extra time. Entrants who have an identified specific learning difficulty should disclose this prior to entry and further assessment would usually be required. For further details, parents are invited to contact the Deputy Head Learning and Wellbeing: m.plint@cheltenhamcollege.org Records Records are kept of both class lessons and individual lessons. A student who has one-to-one lessons takes part in the process of designing a personal programme for the term, depending on his/her needs. A pupil’s school database record advises teaching staff of the pupil’s perceived language proficiency levels, their needs in the mainstream classroom and the support they are receiving. The database is updated regularly.

(Refer to Acceptable Use Policy) • Be subject to on-going evaluation and review by the Council Education Committee, Head, Deputy Head (Academic), the Director of Studies, the Heads of Departments and other committees as appropriate. Respect for Fundamental British Values All staff have a duty to promote fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs. Notably, we must prevent the political indoctrination of pupils through the curriculum. The aim is not to prevent pupils from being expressed to political views - they should be. However, pupils should not be actively encouraged by teachers or others to support particular political viewpoints. This is not restricted to support for political parties. In addition, schools have a duty to encourage respect for alternative lifestyles, even if staff or pupils would not choose the lifestyle for themselves. This covers the protected characteristics defined by the 2010 Equality Act: It is against the law to discriminate against anyone because of: • age • being or becoming a transsexual person • being married or in a civil partnership • being pregnant or having a child • disability • race including colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin • religion, belief or lack of religion/belief • sex • sexual"}

From the beginning, in the Foundation Stage, staff are fostering the development of pupils’ intellectual curiosity, ensuring academic rigour and encouraging children’s ability to learn independently. Although the curriculum at The Prep is based largely on the National Curriculum, in many respects it reaches far beyond. All areas of the school benefit from the expertise of specialist subject teachers – with PE and Swimming, Sport, Modern Language, Drama, Wellbeing and Music specialists teaching in Pre-Prep (Foundation Stage and Key Stage one), and in Lower School (National Curriculum Years 3 and 4). Once the pupils enter Year 5 subject specialists teach more of the curriculum and in Year 6, nearly all of the academic lessons are delivered by specialist teachers. On entering Upper School (Year 7 and Year 8) the pupils either work towards the Independent Schools Examination Board (ISEB) Common Entrance examinations in some subjects and a Cheltenham College curriculum and assessment in others, or Scholarship exams for entry to the 13+ senior school of their choice. Although many pupils continue to Cheltenham College we also prepare pupils for entry to a variety of schools such as Eton, Marlborough, Cheltenham Ladies’ College, Radley and Sherborne. (Refer to yearly overviews of the curriculum) EYFS - Pupils in Foundation Stage 1 (The Nursery School) and Foundation Stage 2 (Reception) follow the Early Years Foundation Stage Framework closely. (Refer to EYFS Policy) The Timetable The Timetable is spread over 5 days for all pupils from Nursery School to Year 8. For Years 5-8, the day is split into lessons of 35 minutes with some subjects being taught in double periods. Pupils in Pre-Prep and Lower School have a timetable structured to meet the needs of their age phase. All pupils from Years 3 to 8 are expected to represent the school in matches on Saturday morning, if selected for a team, and all are expected to attend House Events scheduled on Saturday mornings.

This begins with some initial grouping in Phonics and Numeracy in Pre-Prep, as appropriate, and continues throughout the school in an increasing number of subjects. The structure of setting arrangements enables flexibility to meet the needs of individuals and cohorts within individual subjects. For instance, English may choose to structure sets with two top sets and two parallel lower sets. Science, however, may choose to have a top and bottom set and two parallel middle sets.

This begins with some initial grouping in Phonics and Numeracy in Pre-Prep, as appropriate, and continues throughout the school in an increasing number of subjects. The structure of setting arrangements enables flexibility to meet the needs of individuals and cohorts within individual subjects. For instance, English may choose to structure sets with two top sets and two parallel lower sets. Science, however, may choose to have a top and bottom set and two parallel middle sets. The aim of all structures is to optimise pupil progress. By Year 8 a pupil will be placed in sets for most examined subjects and a set is created for those working towards academic scholarship exams. The pupils selected to attempt an academic scholarship are working to an earlier exam timeframe and to an extended syllabus, therefore a separate group is required to ensure that they have covered the right material and are ready to face their exams in good time. Although avoided as far as possible, some subjects may be tied into setting based on another subject. For instance, children might be taught Art and DT in their French groups. Where this happened, languages should lead setting decisions with excellent differentiation being used to ensure individualised learning in those tied subjects. The decision to place a pupil in a particular set is made to enable him or her to get the best support relative to his or her ability in the subject. Sometimes, a class teacher will feel that a pupil would be better served by changing set; this may follow assessments or exams sat by the entire year group but the decision to move a child will not be based solely on such data. Moving a pupil ‘down’ a set is never a punishment. It is only done when the teacher and the Head of Department consider that the pupil will be better supported in his or her learning by moving at a slightly slower pace, with a different member of staff, or in a different cohort. Parents are asked to trust The Prep’s professional judgement in such matters; we do not take these decisions lightly. When a pupil changes set, the Head of Department will inform the parents and then discuss the proposed change with the pupil so that he or she understands the reasons for moving set. If parents are dissatisfied with such a decision, they should contact the relevant Head of Department or the Deputy Head (Academic). However, it should be re-emphasised that any change of set should leave a pupil in a better position to achieve, through working in a context more appropriate to his or her ability in the subject."}

Introduction This Policy is intended to provide information to Cheltenham College pupils and their parents, carers or guardians (referred to in this policy as \"parents\"), and members of the public about how images are normally used by Cheltenham College It predominantly covers Cheltenham College’s use of pupil images, but also applies to our use of cameras and filming equipment, and images of staff, alumni and visitors attending Cheltenham College-run events and activities. The use of cameras and filming equipment by parents and pupils themselves, and the media, are also covered. It applies in addition to Cheltenham College's other agreements in place with parents and any other information Cheltenham College may provide about our use of images and personal data in general, for example, our Privacy Notices. Images of pupils in a safeguarding context are dealt with under the Cheltenham College’s relevant safeguarding policies. 2. Why do we store and process images? Certain uses of images are necessary for the ordinary running of Cheltenham College; other uses are in the legitimate interests of Cheltenham College and its community and are unlikely to cause any negative impact on individuals. Cheltenham College is entitled lawfully to process such images and take decisions about how to use them, subject to any reasonable objections raised. In addition, our use of images may sometimes rely on consent (for example, Marketing and Publicity). Parents who accept a place for their child at Cheltenham College are invited to indicate agreement to Cheltenham College using images of him/her as set out in this policy by signing the relevant consent form. However, parents should be aware that certain uses of their child's images may be necessary or unavoidable (for example, our use of CCTV for security purposes and identification of pupils for internal administrative purposes). Parents should be aware that, from the age of 13 (or 12 in Scotland) and upwards, the law recognises pupils' own rights to decide and have a say in how their personal information – including images – is used. Any parent (or pupil over the age of 13) who wishes to limit the use of images of a pupil for whom they are responsible can withdraw their consent and request that the details and any images of the pupil are removed from Cheltenham College systems at any time. In addition, any individual (including visitors to Cheltenham College) may object to Cheltenham College's use of their image, as detailed within the Section on Marketing and Publicity. Queries may be directed to either dataprotection@cheltenhamcollege.org, info@cheltenhamcollege.org. or marketing@cheltenhamcollege.org. 2a. Exam Requirements and Performance Analysis As a necessary part of supporting our academic activities, sports fixtures, training sessions, and lessons may be recorded.

This material will either be required as examination evidence (for example, submission to an external exam board in line with the board’s policies and procedures) or used to enhance learning experiences and support educational purposes. Visiting pupils from other schools, academies or Cheltenham Colleges taking part in fixtures may be incidentally recorded, but at no stage will they or visiting members of staff be named. Images 3 captured for these purposes may on occasion be used by the Head in establishing facts in cases of unacceptable pupil behaviour. In such cases the parents and guardians will be informed. 2b. Identification and Security All pupils are photographed on entering Cheltenham College and, thereafter, at intervals, for the purposes of internal identification. These photographs identify the pupil by name, year group, house and form/tutor group. CCTV is in use on Cheltenham College premises, and will sometimes capture images of pupils, parents, staff and visitors to Cheltenham College. Images captured on Cheltenham College's CCTV system are used in accordance with Cheltenham College's CCTV Policy. 2c. Formal Individual and Group Photography Formal individual and group photographs (of year groups, houses, the full school and/or teams) will be taken annually of all pupils and are made available for pupils and their families to purchase via a secure, restricted site. Forenames and surnames will be attached to these formal, official images. They will only be reproduced externally (as detailed in the Section on Marketing and Publicity) if all participants consent to its reproduction. Gillman & Soame is the Data Processor contracted by Cheltenham College to fulfil this purpose. Archival school photographs of Cheltenham College may also be available from their site. Their full Privacy Notice and Data Protection Officer contact details may be found on their website. In cases where a photographer is employed, any images captured remain the property of Cheltenham College and are edited and shared on College devices before distribution via a College email, we therefore remain the Data Processor. 2d. Marketing and Publicity (by Cheltenham College) Images of Pupils Photographs and video footage (live or recorded) may showcase a specific pupil’s achievement or award; the past week’s or fortnight’s events and activities; or a specific event, including sports matches, plays, musical performances, Speech Day, Chapel ceremonies and other Cheltenham College events, visiting seminars and exhibits. We hope parents will feel able to support Cheltenham College in using pupil images to celebrate pupils’ sporting and academic achievements, and to promote the work of Cheltenham College. Where we rely on consent in order to share images of pupils, images featuring pupils without consent who cannot be reasonably identified (i.e. if they are in the distant background or not facing the camera) may still be posted. 4 Use: Names included: Grounds for Processing: Displayed internally on digital and conventional notice boards within Cheltenham College premises.

Images of Visitors to Cheltenham College Cheltenham College reserves the right to use cameras and filming equipment at Cheltenham College to run events. On arrival attendees (which may include parents, guardians, carers, alumni, and other visitors to Cheltenham College) will be informed that photography or filming will take place. Images (without names) taken at these events may be used for press purposes or to promote similar future events. Attendees may request to be positioned out of shot or receive confirmation that any images, featuring themselves, are not to be used by Cheltenham College. Any visitor who wishes to object to Cheltenham College’s use of their image should email the event organiser. Images of Alumni Cheltenham College is committed to maintaining relationships with any alumni (including former staff and parents) who wish to preserve their connection with our community.

Marketing and Publicity (by Third Party Organisations) Images taken by Third Parties Third party organisations may include: • Schools, Academies, Colleges and Universities • Media organisations (including News Outlets) • Organisations beyond the Education Sector hosting events or trips attended by Cheltenham College pupils (for example, a pupil may participate in a concert to raise money for a charity) Parents should be aware that other organisations may take photos of our pupils; for example, during a Sports fixture photographs may be taken of the match. Every reasonable effort will be taken to ensure that third parties are aware that, should they wish to publish images of a specific pupil, they must either ask permission from the pupil and their parents directly or request that Cheltenham College staff do the same on their behalf. Images requested for use by Third Parties Images (taken by Cheltenham College, including images with accompanying names) will only be released to another organisation after additional consent has been given by the pupil and/or their parents or guardian.

Images retained in the ‘Public Interest’ will only be processed in line with Data Protection legislation, which necessarily entails access restriction. 3. Retention Cheltenham College is committed to storing and processing images only for as long as is required by a specific Cheltenham College process or where there is a compelling legitimate case for storing and processing that data. All images are retained in line with our Retention Guidelines. 4. Security All staff are given guidance on Cheltenham College's Policy related to taking, storing and using images of pupils, and on the importance of ensuring that images of pupils are made and used responsibly, only for Cheltenham College purposes, and in accordance with Cheltenham College's policies and the law. External professional photographers and the media are accompanied at all times by a member of staff when on Cheltenham College premises. Cheltenham College uses only reputable professional photographers and makes every effort to ensure that any images of pupils are held by them securely, responsibly and in accordance with Cheltenham College's instructions. Cheltenham College takes appropriate technical and organisational security measures to ensure that images of pupils held by Cheltenham College are kept securely and protected from loss or misuse. Cheltenham College will take reasonable steps to ensure that members of staff only have access to images of pupils held by Cheltenham College where it is necessary for them to do so. 5. Use of Cameras and Filming Equipment by Parents and Pupils 5a. By Parents Parents, guardians or close family members (hereafter, parents) are welcome to take photographs of (and where appropriate, film) their own children taking part in Cheltenham College events, subject to the following guidelines, which Cheltenham College expects all parents to follow: - When an event is held indoors, such as a play or a concert, parents should be mindful of the need to use their cameras and filming devices with consideration and courtesy for cast members or performers on stage and the comfort of others. - In particular, flash photography can disturb others in the audience, or even cause distress for those with medical conditions; Cheltenham College therefore asks that it is not used at indoor events. - Parents are asked not to take photographs of other pupils, except incidentally as part of a group shot, without the prior agreement of that"}

Images which may identify other pupils should not be made accessible to others via the internet (for example on Facebook), or published in any other way without their consent. - Parents are reminded that copyright issues may prevent Cheltenham College from permitting the filming or recording of some plays and concerts. Cheltenham College will always print a reminder in the programme of events where issues of copyright apply. - Parents may not film or take photographs in changing rooms or backstage during Cheltenham College productions, nor in any other circumstances in which photography or filming may embarrass or upset pupils. - Cheltenham College reserves the right to refuse or withdraw permission to film or take photographs (at a specific event or more generally), from any parent who does not follow these guidelines, or is otherwise reasonably felt to be taking inappropriate images. - Cheltenham College may sometimes record plays and concerts professionally (or engage a professional photographer or film company to do so), in which case CD, DVD or digital copies of the DVDs and CDs may be made available to parents for purchase. These copies will only feature visual footage of pupils that have consented to their image being used. They will not identify pupils by name unless prior consent has been given. 5b. By Pupils All pupils are expected to sign and comply with the ICT Pupil Acceptable Use Policy Agreement, which covers the use of cameras and filming equipment (including mobile phones), and any distribution of images. Pupils are encouraged to look after each other, and to report any concerns about the misuse of technology, or any worrying issues to a member of the pastoral staff. The misuse of images, cameras or filming equipment in a way that breaches this policy, or any of Cheltenham College’s other policies is always taken seriously and may be the subject of disciplinary procedures or dealt with under the relevant safeguarding policy as appropriate. 6. Your right to access, rectify, restrict or erase personal data In line with current Data Protection legislation, pupils, parents, staff and visitors to Cheltenham College may request access to, rectification, restriction or erasure of their personal data.

The College is not a body that is required to have regard to the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice (‘Code of Practice’), but it is referenced throughout the assessment as helpful guidance that may assist Cheltenham College to embed good practice. In particular Principle 2 of the Code of Practice states, that the use of a surveillance camera system must consider its effects on individuals and their privacy, with reviews of the system to ensure that its use remains justified. Therefore, in keeping with the spirit of this Code of Practice, and data protection law, Cheltenham College seeks to ensure that privacy risks are minimised, whilst ensuring that the enhanced security and safety that CCTV affords is enabled and maximised for the benefits of Cheltenham College, its pupils, staff, visitors and the wider community. Principle 2 determines the need for privacy impact assessment when CCTV is being developed and that the purpose of the system is assessed as being justified and remains so through a process of regular reviews. There should be consultation with those most affected and an assessment on the impact on privacy undertaken. The level of surveillance should be proportionate to the risk and not a disproportionate impact on privacy. This Privacy Impact assessment seeks to ensure that Cheltenham College’s approach to CCTV surveillance is in line with an individual’s reasonable expectation to privacy. The College Privacy Notice for Pupils, Parents, Guardians and Cheltonian Society members can be found on the following link; https://www.cheltenhamcollege.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Privacy-Notice-for-Pupils-Parents-Guardians-and-Cheltonian-Society-Members-CC-2.pdf Storing and Managing CCTV Images Cheltenham College owns and operates a CCTV surveillance system which was first installed in the late 1990s, has since been added to and now operates around 260 cameras. Images are stored as data files. Cheltenham College has a policy under which CCTV cameras and storage are managed in accordance with relevant legislation. The CCTV Room is staffed 365 days a year. Staff who are required to monitor and download images have been trained to SIA Public Space Licence standards ensure the appropriate level of compliance with legislation for Public Space Cameras, CCTV data recording, monitoring, viewing and retrieval. Only those staff have access to the Security Control room. Staff or visitors to the control room are required to sign a visitor log and have appropriate reason in line with the CCTV policy to view any CCTV. CCTV digital recordings from cameras are accessible from the CCTV Control Room, which is locked when not occupied. CCTV recording equipment is stored securely. Recorded images are retained for 30 days, after which the storage is recorded over. Recorded images are not ordinarily downloaded for storage for a longer period unless for a specified purpose, for example to evidence an accident or incident on site or to support an investigation either internally or through external enforcement agencies. Where recordings are downloaded, this will be undertaken only where a formal request has been made to Cheltenham College.

College-wide CCTV system to provide an added layer of safety and security for pupils, staff and visitors to College. • Enhancing the health and safety of pupils, staff and visitors; • Supporting safeguarding of pupils and visiting pupils • Preventing bullying; • Reducing the incidence of crime and anti-social behaviour (including theft and vandalism); • Protecting Cheltenham College, its buildings, assets, finances, and reputation; • Supporting the Police to deter and detect crime; • Assisting in identifying, apprehending, and prosecuting offenders; • Ensuring that the school rules are respected so that the school can be properly managed; and • Monitoring safety on crossing points on roads surrounding the College Can surveillance camera technology realistically deliver these benefits? CCTV enables monitoring and evidence of trespassers onto the College site, to identify any occurrences of a safety risk to pupils and staff, or of a safeguarding risk to pupils. CCTV has provided evidence of, for example • attempts to steal from cars in boarding houses or to steal bikes, • young people on site climbing onto the roofs of Cheltenham College buildings • trespassers seeking to access Cheltenham College property, and • maintenance working and other contracts not being carried out to the required standard or which raises a safety risk What are the views of those who will be under surveillance? Advice sought from Gloucestershire Highways in 2017 regarding installation of the cameras on the crossing points at Thirlestaine Road and Sandford Road. Other than slight overlaps onto public/private land all other cameras are focused on Cheltenham College site only therefore internal communication with staff. Have other less privacy intrusive solutions such as improved lighting been considered? Cheltenham College operates in a conservation area and where possible there have been improvements in physical barriers and illumination. CCTV cameras provide an added layer of safety, security and safeguarding and provides reassurance. As Cheltenham College is a 24/7 entity that operates 365 days a year, the CCTV system will operate continuously throughout the year. What are the benefits to be gained from using surveillance cameras? Provides examples and evidence of security threats to Cheltenham College, supports Cheltenham College’s approach to improving pupil safety particularly in respect of road safety and provides reassurance. What are the privacy issues arising from the surveillance system? Cheltenham College policy is to not infringe upon an individual’s reasonable expectation to privacy. Images obtained from CCTV may help to; • support an accident investigation • identify and manage safety or security risks • provide Police or other agencies with evidence for their investigations, and • introduce corrective and preventative measures in the light of evidence obtained from the CCTV. Have any privacy by design features been adopted to reduce privacy intrusion? Could any features be introduced as enhancements? Cameras are overt and located so as not to overlook private property that meets with the Cheltenham College boundary and where this is not entirely possible that any overlap of camera coverage from Cheltenham College land onto neighbours is minimised. Images are automatically deleted after 30 days unless legitimate concerns are raised, it is not used to regularly monitor work undertaken by College employees or contractors. Images are securely stored and access is only provided for approved members of staff or to those who have a justifiable interest in the matter. Those managing the cameras are Security Industry Authority licenced and receive training covering the College’s data protection obligations with respect to CCTV footage. What organisations will be using the CCTV images and where is data controller responsibility under the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation?

Images are securely stored and access is only provided for approved members of staff or to those who have a justifiable interest in the matter. Those managing the cameras are Security Industry Authority licenced and receive training covering the College’s data protection obligations with respect to CCTV footage. What organisations will be using the CCTV images and where is data controller responsibility under the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation? Camera monitoring and recording is specified and designed for Cheltenham College use only and the College will be acting as a controller in this regard. The Cheltenham College CCTV policy has a facility for third parties, e.g. enforcement agencies, other bodies, and organisations and individuals, to make a request to view/obtain images for legitimate reasons, e.g. to support a justifiable investigation. Each request will be considered on its merits and in line with applicable data protection law and relevant College policies. Where a third party processes the College’s CCTV footage for its own (internal) purposes that third party will be considered a controller with respect to that processing. In this situation the third party will be responsible for processing the footage in line with its own data protection obligations and individuals should address any concerns with that processing to the third party. The College will provide reasonable assistance to the third party if requested or required. Do the images need to be able to identify individuals or could the scheme use other images not capable of identifying individuals? There will be instances where individuals must be identified for the CCTV footage to be effectively used for the purposes set out above. For example the images may be used to correct the behaviour of pupils and groups of pupils for safeguarding reasons. Similarly, where there is a potential external threat to Cheltenham College then being able to identify an individual will be important and necessary to achieve its intended purposes. The College will not process CCTV footage that can identify individuals when their identification is not necessary. Will the surveillance camera equipment being installed, and the system of work being adopted be sustainable? Is there sufficient money for the scheme? Funding for the scheme is sustainable, Cheltenham College owns all its cameras and there are no broadcast or storage charges. There are no dedicated staffing costs associated with CCTV in Cheltenham College. Will the system/equipment being considered deliver the desired benefit now and in the future? CCTV system meets Cheltenham College’s current organisational needs and does so daily. This is kept under regular review. Cheltenham College operates a large and dispersed site and an organic process of increasing and improving CCTV coverage across the site is progressing. Changes to the external environment, internal risks and changes in technology would also be drivers for adjusting the system in the future. What future demands may arise from wider use of images and how will these be addressed? No plans at present. Privacy Impact Assessment Level 2 Principle 2 of the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice states that ‘The use of a surveillance camera system must consider its effect on individuals and their privacy, with regular reviews to ensure its use remains justified’.

Who Needs a Guardian? It is a requirement that all pupils living outside the UK should have a guardian in this country who will act in loco parentis for them and support the pupil’s welfare. A guardian is also required for pupils whose parents are members of the armed services and are therefore likely to be absent for periods of the school year. For children who are British or Irish whose parents reside in another country, only the Guardianship Forms that Admissions will send to parents needs to be completed and returned to Cheltenham College before their child joins the school. The choice of a nominated guardian is the responsibility of the parent: the school can accept no legal responsibility for any guardianship arrangements. Guardianship arrangements must meet the expectations outlined in this policy. Guardians must be AEGIS accredited (Association for the Education and Guardianship of International Students) to ensure the high standards of professionalism and care necessary to effective safeguarding of the child’s welfare. The only exception would be in instances where parents submit a clear case in writing to the Head of Compliance for consideration (headofcompliance@cheltenhamcollege.org). A member of school staff or their spouse cannot act as a guardian. The guardian needs to be aware of and accept the requirements of this policy and both the parent and the guardian must show that they have accepted our terms laid out in this policy by signing and returning the Guardianship forms that Admissions will send to them. For pupils requiring a visa to study in the UK, AEGIS accredited guardians fully meet UKVI requirements, including that the guardian must be a British Citizen or be settled in the UK and must be living in private accommodation. Furthermore, the guardian must be over 25 years of age and cannot be a student living in shared university accommodation. Upon receipt of the completed documents required by UKVI, the school will be able to issue a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) at Cheltenham College where this is needed, to enable parents to apply for a visa. Documents required include the Guardianship Agreement Form, the Parental Letter of Consent to the travel, reception and care arrangements and the Guardian Letter of Undertaking. The Parental Letter of Consent to travel, reception and care arrangements must be signed in ink; electronic signatures are not permitted. The Admissions Department will send parents the necessary documents. The guardian should live in the vicinity of Cheltenham so they can reach Cheltenham College within a reasonable time should an emergency situation arise. We recommend this must be within two hours’ drive. Close proximity to Cheltenham is essential for international pupils’ guardians so they can offer extra support. The school will monitor the suitability of guardianship arrangements and contact parents and/or guardians should any issues arise. In line with statutory guidance Keeping Children Safe In Education (KCSIE), monitoring processes with pupils are in place to ensure that guardian arrangements are meeting the necessary standards. A random sample of pupils may be contacted during a leave-out (exeat weekends, half-term breaks and holidays) and some may be visited. A survey is sent out following different leave-outs asking how the stay went, if there were any issues and whether the pupil would like to speak to a member of staff. If, in an exceptional circumstance, the guardianship arrangement is not promoting a pupil’s welfare, physical wellbeing and emotional wellbeing then Cheltenham College will liaise with parents and ask them to make alternative arrangements. Any plans to change guardian must be communicated to Cheltenham College in writing so new forms can be issued and held on record for inspection by UKVI. 2. The Guardian’s Role • To act with delegated parental authority in the case of an emergency and in other matters agreed by the parents. • To ensure safe transport"}

The Guardian’s Role • To act with delegated parental authority in the case of an emergency and in other matters agreed by the parents. • To ensure safe transport to and from Cheltenham College for all leave-outs and to communicate all such travel details in writing to the Housemaster, Housemistress or Houseparent. For all leave-outs, Cheltenham College Transport to and from a Guardian’s home and/or airports must be used where a Guardian is not personally providing transport. • To ensure that the child in their charge is resident with the guardian or a host family arranged by the guardian during exeats and half-term holidays unless the child is going home. ‘Bed and Breakfast’ accommodation does not fulfil this requirement. • The guardian is responsible for ensuring that arrangements with any host family provide suitable levels of accommodation and supervision. Agencies should also be cognisant of other pupils from other schools who may be staying with that family so that safeguarding measures can be addressed if necessary (eg. age-appropriate arrangements). • To provide safe care during any absence from Cheltenham College, for example illness, significant mental health issues or disciplinary matters. In the unusual event of the school having to close due to an epidemic or pandemic the guardian will be responsible for collecting and caring for the pupil. • To attend Parents’ / Guardians’ Meetings to follow the pupil’s progress. • To be responsible for the transport and safe storage of all belongings at the end of each academic year. • To be familiar with relevant school rules, regulations and policies. • To be English speaking and provide a point of contact at all times. • To be able to attend Cheltenham College and / or pick up their charge at short notice as necessitated by the school (up to a maximum of 4 hours from request to pick up). Guardians are always welcome at Cheltenham College and are encouraged to take as much interest in their charge as they feel able to.. 3. Passports, Visas and Travel Careful note should be taken of any conditions which are attached to a pupil’s passport at immigration and visas must be kept up to date. Students living outside the UK should consult the Home Office UK Visas and Immigration website www.gov.uk to find out whether a student visa is required and, if so, how to apply for one in the country of residence. Guardians and parents are responsible for telling the Housemaster, Housemistress or Houseparent if flights require Unaccompanied Minor service. Overseas trips: It is the guardian’s responsibility that they organise and apply for any visa required for a pupil to attend an overseas trip being offered by the school. We advise that passports should be given to the Housemaster, Housemistress or Houseparent for safe keeping. On their first arrival in the UK, visa holders must use the staffed immigration entry booths at the airport to have their entry date to the UK stamped in their passport and to validate and link their eVisa to their passport. Every time thereafter that a visa holder travels home for holidays, they are required to retain and provide evidence of departure and arrival travel to the school. It is simplest if they have their passport stamped upon each entry at an immigration booth. Should an eGate be used, alternative evidence includes items such as an e-ticket printout or boarding pass. Matrons will collect evidence of travel and hold it on record. Arrangements for all leave-outs must be requested in advance from Housemasters / Housemistresses via Orah at College or via the Prep systems. Further information will be provided. Any pupil returning to the UK before the start of term must stay with their Guardian upon return, confirming arrangements via Orah or Prep systems. 4."}

Arrangements for all leave-outs must be requested in advance from Housemasters / Housemistresses via Orah at College or via the Prep systems. Further information will be provided. Any pupil returning to the UK before the start of term must stay with their Guardian upon return, confirming arrangements via Orah or Prep systems. 4. Guardian’s absence 4.1 If any designated host family arranged through a guardianship agency is going to be away from their UK home or unable to accommodate a pupil for however short a time, the agency will make suitable alternative arrangements for that period. The guardian must notify the Housemaster, Housemistress or Houseparent of the arrangements and provide the name, address and telephone number of the person who is hosting. 4.2 Where the school has, in an exceptional circumstance, approved the use of a non-AEGIS accredited guardian and they or a replacement guardian arranged by the parents are not available at a time when Cheltenham College requires the pupil to be off site for any of the above stated reasons, Cheltenham College reserves the right to ask an AEGIS accredited guardianship agency to arrange short-term billeting. The cost of this will be passed on to parents. 5. AEGIS accredited Guardians Cheltenham College cannot be responsible for any arrangements between parents and guardians. All AEGIS accredited agencies uphold rigorous standards; whilst Cheltenham College does not recommend any specific agency, parents are welcome to discuss with our Admissions teams.

Introduction Cheltenham College is an established co-educational HMC school educating pupils from the age of 3 to 18. The two schools that form Cheltenham College operate a common Admissions Policy. Our overriding aim is to ensure that every pupil who joins is capable of accessing and achieving in the full breadth and depth of the curriculum, both academic and co-curricular; this forms the basis of our Admissions Policy. While the primary focus is academic, overall, we aim to ensure that every child who is educated at Cheltenham College progresses in a well-rounded manner and has a happy and successful time. Cheltenham College aims to unlock their talents whether previously discovered or not, stretching and challenging pupils in the process. For illustrative purposes, at GCSE the standard curricular expectation includes 9 or 10 subjects. The core curriculum requirement includes English, Maths and at least two sciences. Further detail about achievement and entrance to various stages of education at Cheltenham College is contained in appendix 2 below; please read it. Bursaries are available to enable as many as possible, who meet the admission criteria, to attend Cheltenham College. All enquiries, visits, registrations and admissions to Cheltenham College are communicated and managed via the Admissions Offices. Unless specifically stated, the provisions of this document apply to both the Prep and the Senior School. Further details are available on the School website and in our Admissions and Information Booklet. This policy can be made in larger print or more accessible format if required. Please refer also to the following policies available on the Cheltenham College website or via the Admissions Departments: • Bursary Policy • Equality and Diversity Policy • Disability Policy • Reasonable Adjustment Policy • Learning Support and SEN Policy • English as an Additional Language (EAL) Policy 2 2. Equal Opportunities Cheltenham College is committed to equal opportunity for all, regardless of an applicant’s sex, race, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender reassignment, sexual orientation or social background. Cheltenham College’s aim is to encourage applications from candidates with as diverse a range of backgrounds as possible. This enriches our community and is vital in preparing our pupils for today’s world. Special educational needs and disabilities Cheltenham College welcomes pupils with disabilities and/or special educational needs, provided we can offer them any support that they require and cater for any additional needs in School and that our site can accommodate them. In general, the needs of most pupils with mild specific learning difficulties can be met. Children with specific learning difficulties are assessed using a set procedure at the Admissions stage to ensure that we can offer the support required and that pupils can access the curriculum, achieve and progress in order to enjoy learning and succeed. We strongly advise parents of children with special educational needs, learning difficulties, physical or mental disabilities to discuss their child’s requirements with us before he/she sits the entrance exam/admissions assessments so that we can make adequate provision for them. Parents should provide (with the Registration Form) a copy of any information relating to a child’s learning needs, this may be an educational psychologist’s report or a medical report at the time of application, if they have one. Discussion with parents is ongoing during the application process so families are aware whether the School feels that they can make an adequate provision for the child. The School will also discuss thoroughly with parents (and, with the necessary consent, their child’s medical advisers, if appropriate) the adjustments that can reasonably be made for the child if he/she becomes a pupil at the School. Religious beliefs Although Cheltenham College has Christian roots, the School welcomes applications from prospective pupils of all faiths and of no faith. Cheltenham College does not select for entry on the basis of religious belief."}

Religious beliefs Although Cheltenham College has Christian roots, the School welcomes applications from prospective pupils of all faiths and of no faith. Cheltenham College does not select for entry on the basis of religious belief. 3. Registration Parents may register their child for entry to the school at any time by completing the Online Registration Form (also available from the Admissions Offices) and paying a non-refundable registration fee. Registering a child does not guarantee admission or constitute an offer of a place at Cheltenham College and neither does it in any way bind parents. 4. Admission Process Whilst the School is proud to operate a broad and inclusive entry policy, it is nevertheless academically selective. Entry criteria are fair, apply to all applicants and are set to ensure that all pupils joining Cheltenham College are able to access and thrive whilst studying a syllabus that will usually include Common Entrance (or equivalent subject specific assessments/exams where CE is not followed) prior to Year 9, 9 or 10 GCSE subjects or at Year 12 (16+), 3 A Levels or equivalent and an Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) or 4 A Levels. 3 The specific admissions procedures for each entry level at the School can be found at Appendix 1 of this policy. The dates for the assessment process for the current year are published on our website, together with the dates that results are posted to families and the closing date for acceptances. Places may be offered to candidates from our waiting list after the closing date for acceptances. Parents should contact the School as soon as possible if they or their child require reasonable adjustments to be considered or made during the admissions process. International students We welcome overseas pupils at Cheltenham College, provided that he/she has a relative or has appointed a guardian or responsible adult living in the UK with whom he/she can stay as and when required, more details of which are contained in the School’s Guardianship Policy which is on the website and the Parent Contract (Terms and Conditions). However, parents of overseas pupils should appreciate that we do not run a short-term study programme and expect overseas pupils to finish a complete course of study such as Years 9-11, or Years 12-13. In order to cope with the academic and social demands of Cheltenham College, pupils must be fluent English speakers. Tuition in English as an Additional Language (EAL) can be arranged at the parent’s expense, if required. The School retains the right to require a pupil to attend EAL lessons where (in our opinion) we consider that the pupil does not have sufficient fluency of the English language to gain full access to the curriculum offered by the School. All pupils whose parents are resident overseas, regardless of nationality, and those with parents in the armed services who are likely to be absent for periods in the year must appoint a guardian in the UK to whom pupils may be sent in the event of sickness or school evacuation and must have addressed all issues relating to visa requirements. Upon request, the Admissions Offices will provide the necessary documentation (CAS letter) to enable those pupils requiring a Child Student Visa (previously Tier 4 Visa) to apply. 5. Offer of a Place The decision to admit a pupil is taken by the Deputy Head (Academic) in liaison with the Head. At The Prep, this decision also includes the Deputy Head (Pastoral) and Houseparent (where appropriate). In the event of a pupil not being offered a place, or being offered a conditional place, the reasons in relation to ability to fully access the curriculum and co-curriculum and thrive at College will always be given and any conditions clearly articulated. College does not publish details of results other than to announce those awarded"}

College does not publish details of results other than to announce those awarded and accepting scholarships or exhibitions. 5.1 Acceptance of a place Parents who wish to accept a place for their child at Cheltenham College are required to complete and sign the Acceptance Form and pay a deposit, refundable upon completion of their education at the School. Acceptance of a place is subject to parents agreeing to Cheltenham College’s Parent Contract (Terms and Conditions) which are available on the School website and will be made available to parents as part of the admissions process. 6. Scholarships, Exhibitions and Bursaries 4 Scholarships are available for entry at Year 9 and Year 12. These awards are available for Academics, Art, Drama, Music and Sport. Parents are asked to indicate on the Registration Form whether they wish to apply for a scholarship. Details of the arrangements for applying for a scholarship will be sent to all who express an interest. Bursaries are means tested and are offered at all entry levels to those pupils not otherwise able to afford to access Cheltenham College. These are not dependent on the award of any type of Scholarship; they are made subject to the pupil in question meeting the appropriate entry requirement and availability of funding. Where pupils are offered academic or other awards (for example music or sports scholarships) the value of these awards will be considered alongside bursaries, based on the financial background of the pupil. During a pupil’s time at Cheltenham College, parents whose financial circumstance has changed adversely may also apply for bursary consideration. A bursary may be withdrawn in accordance with the terms upon which such award is made or in accordance with the School’s Parent Contract (Terms and Conditions). Further details of bursary assistance can be obtained via Cheltenham College’s website. Please refer also to the Bursary Policy, a copy of which may be found on the website. 7. Appeals Parents whose child is not offered a place may appeal against this decision by writing to the Chair of the Education Committee within 14 days of receipt of the decision not to offer their child a place. The Chair of the Education Committee decides, after considering the appeal, upon the appropriate course of action to take and may ask to meet with parents for a discussion about their appeal, normally within ten days of receiving the complaint during term time. The Chair of the Education Committee may conduct an investigation of the appeal. Once the Chair of the Education Committee is satisfied that, so far as is practicable, all of the relevant facts have been established, a decision will be made and parents informed of this decision in writing (normally within a further 14 working days after the initial discussion during term time). The Chair of the Education Committee will also give reasons for his/her decision. In any event College aims to respond to any written complaint, including EYFS, within 28 days or as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable. The Chair of the Education Committee can be contacted via the Secretary to Council. 8. Records and review Applicants’ details will be held securely on file with due regard to applicable data protection legislation and Cheltenham College’s Privacy Notice, which is accessible on Cheltenham College’s website. Cheltenham College will not hold the personal data of prospective parents or children for longer than is necessary for a lawful purpose. This will generally be no more than 12 months following an unsuccessful application, but reasons to retain information for longer might include: e.g. if the parents express an interest in the candidate re-applying for any reason at a later date, or in the potential"}

Personal data in successful applications will be transferred to the pupil file to the extent that it is required to provide an education to the child. 5 Appendix 1: Admissions procedures 1. Preparatory School Entrance – Nursery to Year 8 1.1 Nursery Children join us from the term in which they turn three. All children will attend taster sessions to help us to get to know them, and to ensure they will be able to thrive in our structured Nursery day. We require children to be toilet trained to enable them to access the full range of opportunities provided at The Prep. There may be exceptional circumstances where, after full consideration of all the aspects of an individual application, we are unable to offer a place. 1.2 Pre-Prep (Reception to Year 2) Pupils join Pre-Prep from a range of settings with varied experiences and requirements. We believe that assessing academic ability in very young children for entrance purposes can be unreliable and even unsettling, so we do not rely on the academic profile alone when assessing entry up to and including Year 2. We always want to provide the best possible support for each child's curriculum, developmental and social needs and ensure they are able to fully access the curriculum at The Prep. To help ensure they can be appropriately accommodated, all children will be expected to attend a Taster Day so teaching staff have the opportunity to fully understand the child’s social and academic development. There may be exceptional circumstances where, after full consideration of all the aspects of an individual application, we are unable to offer a place. 1.3 Lower School and Middle School (Years 3-6) Entry into Years 3-6 is based upon our assessment of a child’s ability to access the full breadth and depth of the curriculum. Pupils are expected to attend a Taster Day, during which assessment takes place. Assessment takes the form of CAT4 assessments in Verbal, Non-Verbal, Spatial and Quantitative Reasoning and a short written English paper or EAL test. A pastoral interview is included. CAT4 results from another school setting can be used as long as they are less than 12 months old. This helps give staff a snapshot of the strengths and areas for development of each child. If a pupil finds these assessments particularly challenging, they may be referred to the Learning Support Department so that staff can spend a little longer with them on a 1:1 basis to understand their learning profile. Following this, dialogue will take place between the School and parents to discuss the specific needs of the pupil and how these might be met if they were offered a place at the Prep. EAL assessments ensure that the child’s level of English is sufficient for them to be supported in accessing the curriculum and that they can settle into the school environment, further supported by additional EAL lessons where needed. These EAL lessons are charged to parents each term (see the EAL Policy on the website). Entry into Years 3-6 does not guarantee entry to the Senior School at the end of Year 8. All pupils are required to participate in the separate entrance process (see below) to gain a place for Year 9 onwards. If boarding is being sought at any stage from Year 3 onwards, the taster day includes a sleepover in the boarding house. 1.4 Upper School (Years 7-8) Entry into Year 7 is via the Year 6 Entrance@11 Day, which includes English and Maths tests"}

If boarding is being sought at any stage from Year 3 onwards, the taster day includes a sleepover in the boarding house. 1.4 Upper School (Years 7-8) Entry into Year 7 is via the Year 6 Entrance@11 Day, which includes English and Maths tests taken on the day, and CAT4 assessments. Those who may apply later than this event would take the usual entry tests consisting of the CAT4 assessments plus written papers in English 6 and Maths which are shared with College. The Entrance Day normally takes place in the November of Year 6. Entry into Year 8 is via CAT4 assessments and through Cheltenham College’s entrance papers in Maths and English. Pupils for whom English is an additional language, also take an EAL paper. Entry at, and into, Year 7 and 8 normally leads to entry into the Senior School at 13+ (Year 9) except where the Heads, in their absolute discretion, are not satisfied that it is appropriate for the pupil to progress into the Senior School, having regard to the pupil’s academic attainment and all other relevant circumstances. 1.5 Exclusion Entry to College is not normally open to a pupil who has been excluded from Cheltenham Prep. 2. Senior School (College) Entrance - Age 13 to 18 Pupils enter the Senior School at Year 9 (13+), Year 10 (14+) and Year 12 (16+). Entry into Year 9 is either via the ISEB 13+ Common Entrance examinations or via College Entrance or Scholarship papers. Entry into Year 10 (14+) is via College Entrance papers. Entry into Sixth Form (16+) is via College Entrance or Scholarship papers. Entry at Year 12 is also subject to: • achieving a minimum of 5 grade 6s or the equivalent at GCSE; many courses at A-Level also require specific entry requirements and these are all stated in the Sixth Form booklet on the website. • CAT4 assessment, except for international pupils whose native language is not English, who take UKISET instead. • Receipt of a satisfactory school reference International pupils of all ages whose native language is not English will be required to provide a full UKISET report with their registration or sit the OPT exam, the College EAL paper and CAT 4. All pupils will have a Skype interview with a member of the academic staff. To allow parents earlier peace of mind that a Year 9 place is secure, Cheltenham College offers early assessment of pupils during Year 6, 32 months in advance of entry. Pupils attend the College Entrance Day during which they participate in English and Maths tests as well as a number of discussions and activities. Suitability for the full breadth and depth of the College curriculum, both academic and co-curricular is assessed. Suitability criteria include attitude, participation, collaboration, behaviour, knowledge, expression during interview and skills demonstrated. SEN information must be made available in advance so that it can be taken into consideration during the assessment. Satisfactory reports about performance in relation to the above criteria, in combination with a satisfactory reference from the pupil’s current school, forms the basis for College to make place offers, together with a House allocation, for entry in Year 9. Usually offers are made within approximately two weeks of Entrance Day. However, where necessary SEN information and references from the current school are not received two weeks prior to Entrance Day, Cheltenham College may not be able to offer a place within the usual time period; it is important that there be adequate time to follow up and/or liaise further where necessary. The offer will be subject to successful completion of Common Entrance examinations in June of Year 8 or College Entrance Exam papers post November of Year 8. 2.1 Senior School (College) Boarding House Allocation 7 When parents register their child for a place at College, or any time thereafter, they are invited to"}

It is recommended that parents state a first and a second choice of House. College will endeavor to allocate places according to these preferences but reserves the right to place a pupil in a different House if space is not available or if it is in the interests of a good community balance. If the application is considered a late entry, then it is possible that an unallocated house place or wait list option will be offered. We do not hold long wait lists, so as to give a child every opportunity to either consider another option or resolve to come to College. However, if an offer is made it is essential that a decision is received quickly, so as to secure the place as a 'Final Acceptance' in the College system. Once at College, pupils may only change House with the permission of the Deputy Head Pastoral. Only in exceptional circumstances will House changes be considered and only if the pupil is changing Boarding Status. House changes that do occur will only be actioned at the beginning of a new academic year. New pupils joining the College will have preference on available spaces. A limited number of Day Boarding places are available each year. Normally 25% of any year group, unless there is bed availability. However, we reserve the right to allocate boarding/day boarding spaces as we see fit within a balance of boarding and day boarding. Registration for these places is recommended at least 4-5 years prior to entry. A change of status from Boarding to Day requires a term’s notice. 8 Appendix 2: Achievement and entrance to next phase We are committed to the wellbeing and success of each child throughout their time at Cheltenham College. Ensuring their continued progress and fulfilment of potential is underpinned by a strong set of aims, broad and balanced curriculum, inspirational teaching and learning, and assessment. Cheltenham College is ambitious in its aspirations for each pupil and is committed to ensuring individuals are well placed to meet their academic potential. We believe that communication is at the heart of an effective partnership between home and school which is essential to ensure pupils are able to thrive. Therefore, any concerns, including SEN or EAL, are identified and shared as early as possible to ensure any additional support can be targeted in collaboration with the child's parents. Further information about additional support is available in (3) below and in the Learning Support and SEN Policy and the EAL Policy, both of which are available on the website. 1. The Prep 1.1 Pre-Prep (Nursery to Year 2) Assessment of pupils is ongoing and underpinned by teacher observation as well as some more specific tasks which provide feedback as to a pupil’s preferred way of learning, potential and understanding in some key subjects. These help inform the planning of teachers and aid identification of any areas that may require consolidation or support. Any concerns regarding pupil progress, development or ability to access the curriculum will be discussed with parents. 1.2 Lower School (Years 3 and 4) Ongoing assessment of pupils through teacher observation and more formal assessed tasks help inform staff and parents of the progress a pupil is making, with any concerns about progress being discussed with parents. 1.3 Middle School (Years 5 and 6) The progress of pupils is reviewed on an ongoing basis in Middle School to ensure they can adequately access the full breadth of the curriculum. All pupils sit assessments at the end of and at other key points of Year 5 and"}

All pupils sit assessments at the end of and at other key points of Year 5 and 6, and these are reviewed in conjunction with their academic ability profile to ensure they are meeting their full potential. Pupils who may be considered as not attaining this or have caused some concern are highlighted and staff meet to discuss what support can be given (usually provided by the regular teachers in class or by a general learning support worker attached to the whole set) to help the child achieve their best. Ensuring pupils are well suited to the requirements of College and able to thrive is extremely important. Therefore, time is taken at this stage to fully assess and discuss the suitability of pupils to this environment in preparation for them leaving The Prep at the end of Year 8. At the end of Year 8, the majority of pupils, having successfully completed the Entrance@11 process for entry to College, go on to College and continue their academic journey. During November of Year 6 the main entrance process into College (Entrance@11) takes place and offers of places are made by the end of the Autumn term. This process involves reviewing cognitive ability profiles, observing pupils participating in a variety of activities during the entrance day and taking English and Maths tests. An election meeting follows, where each pupil is discussed. This holistic process aims to ensure that College is able to meet the needs of pupils and that it will be the best environment for individuals to thrive both pastorally and academically, given the full breadth of the GCSE curriculum already described. Where there are concerns that this might not be the case, a place may not be offered. Ongoing assessment and dialogue between The Prep, College and parents help inform the next steps to ensure the best interests of the pupil. 9 1.4 Upper School (Years 7 and 8) All pupils are monitored closely in Upper School with exams in May and assessments at the end of the Autumn and Spring Terms. This data is compared to their academic potential and any concerns discussed with parents. The pupils who are identified as having a strong academic profile through the cognitive ability testing that takes place are monitored closely by the Deputy Head (Academic) and Academic Heads of Department to ensure they are being sufficiently challenged and to identify the suitability of individuals for preparation for scholarship application. Pupils in Year 7 sit Progress Tests in English and Maths at the end of the year so that progress can be monitored. 2. Cheltenham College 2.1 Common Entrance/Upper School Assessment Framework For candidates with a confirmed place, Common Entrance at 13+ and the Upper School Assessment Framework in non CE subjects is used internally for setting purposes in Third Form (Year 9). Where Common Entrance results are below the usual pass mark (average of 55%) and there may be concerns about his or her ability to access the curriculum, parents will be invited in to meet the College Deputy Head (Academic) immediately following Common Entrance to discuss the monitoring and support required. An evaluation of progress and attainment is made at the end of Autumn Term and shared with parents. 2.2 Entrance to the Sixth Form Pupils are required to gain a minimum of 5 grade 6s (or alphabetical equivalent) at GCSE for entry into the Sixth Form. Parents of pupils who are at risk of missing this bar are written to in June of Fourth Form (Year 10), and the Head of Lower College monitors their progress closely throughout Fifth Form (Year 11). Parents are invited to discuss with senior staff whether College is the most appropriate place"}

Parents are invited to discuss with senior staff whether College is the most appropriate place for their son or daughter to thrive in Sixth Form. Mock Exam results in January are used to help inform a final decision about an ongoing place in the Sixth Form. Where a pupil does not achieve the minimum 5 grade 6s, admission to Sixth Form may be granted at the Head’s discretion. In these cases, a pupil’s academic and disciplinary record to date will be closely scrutinised. 3. Support for Pupils Full details of provision available can be found as part of the Learning Support and SEN Policy or the EAL Policy for the respective schools, which are on the website. Most support is provided initially by class teachers through differentiated activities. From Year 3 onwards, where extra lessons with specialist staff are needed, arrangements are agreed in advance with parents. Such lessons are charged each term. A specific learning difficulty or additional needs may only become apparent as a pupil matures, and the same criteria for entry to the next phase will be applied as all pupils move through the school; ensuring pupils continue to be able to fully access the curriculum, achieve their potential and progress as this is essential to their welfare and self-esteem."}

CHELTONIAN SOCIETY MEMBERS The Cheltonian Society, on Cheltenham College’s behalf, processes personal data for a range of purposes, including administration of its membership. On an ad hoc basis the Cheltonian Society will also request explicit consent prior to publishing named photographs of its membership and associated individuals. The Society also expects that the following uses may fall within that category of its (or its community’s) “legitimate interests”: 6 • To share general images of former pupils and other members of the wider Cheltenham College community (including staff) in accordance with Cheltenham College’s policy on taking, storing and using images of children. Please refer to the Photography and Film Policy for more information. Further information relating to keeping in touch and supporting Cheltenham College may be found later in this privacy notice. TYPES OF PERSONAL DATA PROCESSED BY CHELTENHAM COLLEGE This will include by way of example: • names, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses and other contact details of individuals referenced within this Privacy Notice; • where appropriate in order to support the pupil, family history (including family bereavement); • car details (about those who use our car parking facilities); • bank details and other financial information, e.g. about parents who pay fees to Cheltenham College; • past, present and prospective pupils' academic, disciplinary, admissions and attendance records (including information about any special needs), and examination scripts and marks; • standardised baseline data; • certified copies of birth certificates (as evidence of relationship between a child and their parents to meet UKVI requirements for a Tier 4 visa), passport details and Tier 4 visa status; • unique candidate numbers for examinations and university applications; • where appropriate, information about individuals' health, and contact details for their next of kin; • references given or received by Cheltenham College about pupils, and information provided by previous educational establishments and/or other professionals or organisations working with pupils; and • images of pupils (and occasionally other individuals) engaging in Cheltenham College activities, and images captured by Cheltenham College’s CCTV system. • video recordings of pupils engaging in online classroom activity during periods of remote learning for the purposes of revision and to provide our international cohort with access to lessons who are in different time zones. • travel plan data for the purposes of drop off and collection during the school holidays. • details of sporting fixtures for the purposes of having a single data entry point system for staff, parents and pupils to have access to team sheets. HOW CHELTENHAM COLLEGE COLLECTS DATA Generally, Cheltenham College receives personal data from the individual directly (including, in the case of pupils, from their parents). This may be via a form, or simply in the ordinary course of interaction or communication (such as email or written assessments). However, in some cases personal data may be supplied by third parties (for example, another school, or other professionals or authorities working with that individual). Information may also be 7 collected from publicly accessible sources, for example, in order to conduct significant donor due diligence. WHO HAS ACCESS TO PERSONAL DATA AND WHO CHELTENHAM COLLEGE SHARES IT WITH Data available within Cheltenham College will be processed by appropriate individuals only in accordance with access protocols (i.e. on a ‘need to know’ basis) and, occasionally, with the President and members of Council. Particularly strict rules of access apply in the context of: • Medical records which are held and accessed only by Cheltenham College doctor and appropriate medical staff under his/her supervision, or otherwise in accordance with express consent; • Special educational needs files; and • Pastoral or safeguarding files. However, a certain amount of any SEN pupil’s relevant information will need to be provided to staff more widely"}

Particularly strict rules of access apply in the context of: • Medical records which are held and accessed only by Cheltenham College doctor and appropriate medical staff under his/her supervision, or otherwise in accordance with express consent; • Special educational needs files; and • Pastoral or safeguarding files. However, a certain amount of any SEN pupil’s relevant information will need to be provided to staff more widely in the context of providing the necessary care and education that the pupil requires. Staff, pupils and parents are reminded that Cheltenham College is under duties imposed by law and statutory guidance (including Keeping Children Safe in Education) to record or report incidents and concerns that arise or are reported to it, in some cases regardless of whether they are proven, if they meet a certain threshold of seriousness in their nature or regularity. This may include file notes on personnel or safeguarding files, and in some cases referrals to relevant authorities such as the LADO or police. Further information about this can be found within our Child Protection and Safeguarding Policy. Occasionally, Cheltenham College will need to share personal information relating to its community with third parties, such as professional advisers (lawyers or accountants) or relevant authorities (HMRC, Gloucestershire Safeguarding Children Board, police or the local authority). Cheltenham College may also share personal data with third parties who provide academic support (i.e. for teaching practices or testing and homework practice for pupils), with examination boards (i.e. when submitting grades and processing access arrangement applications), and professionals who specialise in support for Special Educational Needs, English as an Additional Language (EAL) and health. For the most part, collected personal data will remain within Cheltenham College. However, some personal data may be transferred beyond the European Economic Area. This may be necessary for a range of reasons; for example, to communicate effectively with a pupil’s parents or agents who are based overseas, to provide a reference to an overseas educational institution, to access an online educational resource (subject to explicit consent provided by or on behalf of the pupil), to arrange for a Tier 4 Visa, or due to another legal obligation. In accordance with Data Protection Law, some of Cheltenham College’s processing activity is carried out on its behalf by third parties, such as IT systems, web developers or cloud storage providers. This is always subject to contractual assurances that personal data will be kept securely and only in accordance with Cheltenham College’s specific directions. 8 HOW LONG WE KEEP DATA Cheltenham College will retain personal data securely and only in line with how long it is necessary to keep for a legitimate and lawful reason. Typically, the legal recommendation for how long to keep ordinary staff personal files and the pupil educational record is up to 7 years following departure from Cheltenham College (assuming the age of the pupil on departure in 18). However, incident reports, special educational needs files and safeguarding files will need to be kept much longer, in accordance with specific legal requirements. Moreover, Cheltenham College may retain some personal data relating to pupils and members of staff for archiving purposes (including historical research) in order to preserve and commemorate Cheltenham College’s community and heritage. Records held for archive purposes are held subject to strict closure periods as required by Data Protection Law, as detailed within the Archive & Heritage Collections Policy. If you have any specific queries about how this policy is applied or wish to request that personal data that you no longer believe to be relevant is considered for erasure, please contact the Data Protection Manager. However, please bear in mind that Cheltenham College may have lawful and necessary reasons to hold on to some data. KEEPING IN TOUCH AND SUPPORTING CHELTENHAM COLLEGE In addition to compliance with current Data Protection legislation, Cheltenham College and the Cheltonian Society operates in line with the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (2003) Act, and will request explicit consent in order to: • Maintain relationships with alumni"}

KEEPING IN TOUCH AND SUPPORTING CHELTENHAM COLLEGE In addition to compliance with current Data Protection legislation, Cheltenham College and the Cheltonian Society operates in line with the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (2003) Act, and will request explicit consent in order to: • Maintain relationships with alumni and Cheltenham College community, including direct marketing and fundraising activity. CHELTONIAN SOCIETY The Cheltonian Society may request the consent of alumni, parents, staff and other members of Cheltenham College’s community to use their contact details to keep them updated about Cheltenham College activities, or events of interest, including sending updates and newsletters by email and by post. DEVELOPMENT Cheltenham College may contact individuals who consent to keep them updated about Cheltenham College activities, or events of interest. In addition, Cheltenham College may contact individuals who consent, including members of the 1841 Society and the Hugh Reeves Legacy Society, with information regarding opportunities to raise funds and support the development of Cheltenham College and, where appropriate, other worthy causes actively supported by current pupils. Cheltenham College may collect information from publicly available sources about individual’s occupations and activities, in order to maximise Cheltenham College’s fundraising potential and conduct donor due diligence. Individuals may be grouped with similar people who may be able to 9 give at a particular level or who have similar interests. This practice reduces the likelihood that individuals will be contacted about projects to which they cannot or do not wish to support. YOUR RIGHTS Individuals have various rights under Data Protection Law to access and understand personal data about them held by Cheltenham College, and in some cases ask for it to be erased or amended or for Cheltenham College to stop processing it, subject to certain exemptions and limitations. Any individual wishing to access or amend their personal data or wishing it to be transferred to another person or organisation, or who has some other objection to how their personal data is used, should put their request in writing to the Data Protection Manager. Cheltenham College will endeavour to respond to any such written requests as soon as is reasonably practicable and in any event within statutory time-limits, which is one month in the case of requests for access to information. Cheltenham College will be better able to respond quickly to smaller, targeted requests for information. If the request is manifestly excessive or similar to previous requests, Cheltenham College may ask you to reconsider or charge a proportionate fee, but only where Data Protection Law allows it. You should be aware that certain data is exempt from the right of access. This may include information which identifies other individuals, or information which is subject to legal professional privilege. Cheltenham College is also not required to disclose any pupil examination scripts (though examiners' comments may fall to be disclosed), nor any confidential reference given by Cheltenham College for the purposes of the education, training or employment of any individual. PUPIL REQUESTS Pupils can make subject access requests for their own personal data, provided that, in the reasonable opinion of Cheltenham College, they have sufficient maturity to understand the request they are making (see section Whose Rights below). Indeed, while a person with parental responsibility will generally be entitled to make a subject access request on behalf of younger pupils, the information in question is always considered to be the child’s at law. A pupil of any age may ask a parent or other representative to make a subject access request on his/her behalf. Moreover (if of sufficient age) their consent or authority may need to be sought by the parent making such a request. Pupils within College (i.e. aged 13 and above) are generally assumed to have this level of maturity, although this will depend on both the child and the personal data requested, including any relevant circumstances at home. Slightly younger children within Cheltenham Prep may"}

A pupil of any age may ask a parent or other representative to make a subject access request on his/her behalf.

Pupils within College (i.e. aged 13 and above) are generally assumed to have this level of maturity, although this will depend on both the child and the personal data requested, including any relevant circumstances at home. Slightly younger children within Cheltenham Prep may however also be sufficiently mature to have a say in this decision. All information requests from, or on behalf of, pupils – whether made under subject access or simply as an incidental request – will therefore be considered on a case by case basis. CONSENT Where Cheltenham College is relying on consent as a means to process personal data, any person may withdraw this consent at any time (subject to similar age considerations as above). Please be 10 aware however that Cheltenham College may have another lawful reason to process the personal data in question even without your consent. That reason will usually have been asserted under this Privacy Notice, or may otherwise exist under some form of contract or agreement with the individual (e.g. an employment or parent contract, or because a purchase of goods, services or membership of an organisation such as the Cheltonian Society or Friends of the Prep has been requested). WHOSE RIGHTS The rights under Data Protection Law belong to the individual to whom the data relates. However, Cheltenham College will often rely on parental consent to process personal data relating to pupils (if consent is required) unless, given the nature of the processing in question, and the pupil's age and understanding, it is more appropriate to rely on the pupil's consent. Parents should be aware that in such situations they may not be consulted, depending on the interests of the child, the parents’ rights at law or under their contract, and all the circumstances. In general, Cheltenham College will assume that pupils’ consent is not required for ordinary disclosure of their personal data to their parents, e.g. for the purposes of keeping parents informed about the pupil's activities, progress and behaviour, and in the interests of the pupil's welfare, unless, in Cheltenham College's opinion, there is a good reason to do otherwise. However, where a pupil seeks to raise concerns confidentially with a member of staff and expressly withholds their agreement to their personal data being disclosed to their parents, Cheltenham College may be under an obligation to maintain confidentiality unless, in Cheltenham College's opinion, there is a good reason to do otherwise; for example, where Cheltenham College believes disclosure will be in the best interests of the pupil or other pupils, or if required by law. Pupils are required to respect the personal data and privacy of others, and to comply with Cheltenham College's ICT Pupil Policy and Cheltenham College rules. Staff are under professional duties to do the same covered under the Staff ICT Acceptable Use Policy, in addition to our Data Protection Policy and any policies relating to safeguarding referred to within this Privacy Notice. DATA ACCURACY AND SECURITY Cheltenham College will endeavour to ensure that all personal data held in relation to an individual is as up to date and accurate as possible. Individuals must please notify Admissions (if prospective), College Office (if current), or the Cheltonian Society (if a member or) of any significant changes to important information, such as contact details, held about them. Individuals with a former association with Cheltenham College or the Cheltonian Society who wish to get back in touch or make a request regarding any personal day still held may contact the main reception at College and/or Cheltenham Prep, the Data Protection Manager or Cheltenham College Archive (archives@cheltenhamcollege.org).

This will be known as the ‘Local Offer’. 1. How does the early years setting know if children need extra help and what should I do if I think my child may have special educational needs or disabilities? The Pre-Prep follow the Early Years Foundation Stage curriculum and offer Free Entitlement for eligible children in the Reception class. We identify children with special educational needs in the following ways: • Previous records and discussions with parents/carers and other settings. • Careful observations of a child in school. • Experienced and well qualified staff. • In-house qualified SENCO. • Assessments both in-house and external if appropriate. • Close working with other agencies as required. Our staff work closely with parents. We operate an ‘open door’ policy and welcome comments and queries. We believe children learn better if they see teachers and parents working together for their benefit. • If we have concerns regarding your child’s development, we will talk to you about why we feel support may be needed. • Parents can chat to class teachers, Head of Foundation Stage and SENCO and make appointments for a longer or more formal meeting by emailing staff. 2. How will Early Years setting staff support my child? • The Pre-Prep is well-resourced in terms of staff and equipment. • Our SENCO will work closely with you, the class teacher and teaching assistant, explaining the support we are providing, and progress made. • Our high staff ratio enables opportunities for individual attention for all children and children have a dedicated key person. • We will produce differentiated plans, and these can be shared with you. The plans will be reviewed and amended regularly. • We will develop a shared approach to support and education, so your child has a consistent approach with home and school. • We will communicate regularly. • We will keep careful records charting progress. • We will liaise with other agencies as appropriate. • We will attend training to familiarise ourselves with a specific condition. • We have on-site qualified medical staff. 3.

It occasionally happens that a pupil or pupil's behaviour falls beyond the range of these sanctions. Under these circumstances, it may be necessary to exclude a pupil from College or Cheltenham Prep. That exclusion may be temporary – Suspension; or permanent - Exclusion. 1. Suspension 1.1 At both schools a pupil may be liable to suspension if he or she is in serious or repeated breach of any Cheltenham College regulation. The decision to suspend is at the discretion of the Deputy Head Pastoral or Head. Some offences are liable to immediate suspension and include: any behaviour that puts a pupil at risk, the misuse of alcohol, repeatedly smoking and/or vaping, serious bullying concerns (either repeated incidents or a single serious incident), cheating or plagiarism, serious breaches of the ICT Acceptable Use Policy, theft, demeaning and/or persistently poor behaviour. This list is illustrative rather than exhaustive and the degree and nature of behaviour that merits suspension will be considered in an age appropriate context. 1.2 In most cases where a pupil is suspended, he or she will be given a warning in a letter to parents, which includes a warning as to the consequences if there is repetition of the behaviour that led to the suspension. 1.3 In the most serious circumstances a pupil will be given a Final Warning in a letter to parents, which means that any repetition of the offence or any other serious breach of school regulations throughout the pupil’s remaining time at College, is likely to lead to permanent exclusion. The issuing of a Final Warning will be in writing and normally involves parents or guardians in a discussion with the Head or Deputy Head Pastoral (DHP). 1.4 Any second suspension offence is also likely to result in a Final Warning. 2 1.5 Any pupil who has been suspended is expected to keep up with all of his or her academic work during the period of suspension. Cheltenham College will provide detail on the work to be covered. 2. Permanent Exclusion and Withdrawal 2.1 Permanent exclusion (commonly known as expulsion): At the discretion of the Head, and with the President of the Council notified (see 4.13), a pupil may be liable to permanent exclusion if he or she is in serious or repeated breach of any school regulation. Some offences are liable to immediate permanent exclusion. At College this might include, for example: serious breaches of the Controlled Drugs Policy, the serious or repeated misuse of alcohol, serious bullying, either repeated or one serious incident, engaging in a sexual relationship, and at both schools: acting in a way that endangers the safety of other people, wilful damage to property, theft, breaking out of a boarding house, behaviour likely to bring Cheltenham College into disrepute or the breaching of the terms of a Final Warning. This list is illustrative rather than exhaustive. 2.2 Withdrawal: Parents have the right to withdraw the pupil at any point prior to notification in writing of the outcome of the disciplinary meeting under 4.12 (below). The parent contract details the procedure to be followed in these circumstances. 3. Overview of Process 3.1 Incidence of serious alleged misconduct will be investigated by senior members of staff, typically the Deputy Head Pastoral (DHP), the Assistant Head Pastoral (AHP) or Senior Housemaster or Housemistress (SHsM), in conjunction with a pupil's HsM. 3.2 Conducting the investigation: In the event of a report or suspicion of misconduct, an investigation will be conducted by a senior"}

Overview of Process 3.1 Incidence of serious alleged misconduct will be investigated by senior members of staff, typically the Deputy Head Pastoral (DHP), the Assistant Head Pastoral (AHP) or Senior Housemaster or Housemistress (SHsM), in conjunction with a pupil's HsM. 3.2 Conducting the investigation: In the event of a report or suspicion of misconduct, an investigation will be conducted by a senior member of staff. This may include: a) Gathering evidence; b) Interviews with pupils, members of staff and others; c) Taking written statements, usually in order to establish a clear order of events; d) Segregation of pupils pending interviews; e) Pupils may undertake a period of Home Leave while the investigation takes place; and f) Liaison with parents/guardians and, where appropriate or where this is a legal requirement, other agencies (e.g. police, social services). It is not appropriate to have parents or other representatives of the pupil present at this stage. However, parents will be informed as soon as reasonably practicable if a complaint or allegation under investigation is of a nature that could result in the pupil being excluded. 3.3 The pupil will have a member of staff accompany him/her to any interview (but not the disciplinary meeting) during the disciplinary process. This member of staff may be the tutor, HsM or matron. 3.4 Findings of a disciplinary investigation are presented to the Head for consultation and consideration. For matters involving Suspension, the DHP or Senior HsM may be delegated to convey this decision to a pupil, their HsM and Parents. 3.5 Other agencies may be notified at any stage of the procedure, as and when necessary and appropriate. 3.6 Suspension: While an investigation takes place a pupil may be asked to remain at home or with their guardian. Cheltenham College will support the pupil by sending suitable academic work to complete at home or where they are staying, and also by offering access to pupil services, i.e. Counsellors, where the 3 College considers it would be helpful. A member of staff not involved in the investigation (usually the pupil’s tutor or HsM) will be allocated to contact the pupil to ensure they are supported during this time. 3.7 Searches: In gathering evidence apart from interviews, searches of pupils’ possessions will be conducted in line with the Search and Confiscation Policy. Drugs, weapons and other items will be confiscated immediately if they are considered as potential evidence. 3.8 Segregation: It may be necessary to segregate pupils. For the purposes of reliable segregation, Cheltenham College may confiscate a pupil’s mobile telephone and laptop for such a period as it reasonably deems necessary. 4. The Disciplinary Meeting 4.1 A formal disciplinary meeting is necessary in cases where permanent exclusion is a possible outcome or when a pupil is suspended pending a disciplinary outcome. 4.2 Preparation: The pupil and the pupil’s parents/guardians will be informed of the date, time and place of the disciplinary meeting and Cheltenham College’s expectation that they or the pupil’s guardian should attend (if possible). If the pupil and the pupil’s parents wish to rely on written submissions these should be sent to arrive at the Head’s office at least the working day before the disciplinary meeting. Where possible, documents that will be made available to the parents and the pupil before the disciplinary meeting include, but are not limited to, a statement setting out the allegation, written statements and notes of the evidence supporting the allegation, the relevant Cheltenham College policies and procedures, and the investigation report. Any such documents may be redacted or a summary provided for reasons of confidentiality and/or data protection. 4.3 Attendance: The pupil and parents/guardians should attend the disciplinary meeting. Other representatives of the pupil or parents/guardian are not permitted. 4.4 Proceedings: The Head will conduct the disciplinary meeting in a manner appropriate to the age, maturity and understanding of the individual pupil concerned. 4.5 Notes will be taken of the disciplinary meeting. 4.6 The pupil should be present throughout the disciplinary meeting,"}

Other representatives of the pupil or parents/guardian are not permitted. 4.4 Proceedings: The Head will conduct the disciplinary meeting in a manner appropriate to the age, maturity and understanding of the individual pupil concerned. 4.5 Notes will be taken of the disciplinary meeting. 4.6 The pupil should be present throughout the disciplinary meeting, which will usually involve: • an explanation of how the meeting will be conducted and the role of those present; • a description of the offence and the disciplinary sanction(s) that could be imposed; • a summary of the evidence which will include the pupil’s account of the events; • an opportunity for the pupil and his/her parents/guardians to be heard and ask questions about the disciplinary meeting; and • an opportunity for the pupil and his/her parents/guardians to address the Head on the issue of the sanction to be imposed. 4.7 The Head may adjourn the hearing for any reason, which will be explained to the pupil. 4.8 The Head will decide whether the allegation against the pupil has been proved on the balance of probabilities (i.e. whether it is more likely than not). 4 4.9 If the Head, having considered the evidence including any admission by the pupil, decides that the allegation against the pupil is proved, he/she will consider what sanction is to be imposed and inform the pupil and parents/guardians. 4.10 If the Head considers that the misconduct may warrant withdrawal or permanent exclusion, he/she may consider: • Any relevant previous disciplinary issues concerning the pupil; and • Any other favourable or unfavourable conduct known to the College. 4.11 An explanation of the appeal procedure will be offered if permanent exclusion is the outcome. 4.12 The decision will always be confirmed in writing, normally within 3 working days of the disciplinary meeting. The letter will state the decision in relation to the allegation (or each of them), the sanction and when it takes effect. 4.13 The Head will notify the President of Council of any decision to exclude permanently, at the appropriate time. 5. Leaving Status 5.1 When a pupil permanently leaves Cheltenham College their leaving status will be one of the following: ‘excluded’ or ‘withdrawn by parents’. 5.2 Public examinations: Pupils who have permanently left Cheltenham College shall not be permitted to sit public examinations at Cheltenham College, irrespective of the timing of the offence(s). The Head has discretion to permit a pupil to sit public examinations as an exception to this paragraph 5.2. 5.3 Cheltenham College premises: Pupils who have permanently left Cheltenham College are not permitted to re-enter Cheltenham College premises without prior consent from Cheltenham College. 5.4 Coursework: Cheltenham College may make arrangements for the transfer of any course and project work to the leaving pupil, the parents or another school. 6. Council Review 6.1 Where a pupil has been permanently excluded, the parent/guardian may appeal against the decision by way of a Council review. This does not extend to Home Leave pending an investigation or suspensions given as a sanction, i.e. temporary exclusion. Pending such appeal, the pupil shall remain suspended from Cheltenham College. 6.2 Request for review: A pupil or his/her parents, upon notification of the Head’s decision to exclude, may make a written application for a Council review. The application must be received by the Secretary to the Council within 72 hours of the decision being notified to a parent in writing, or longer by agreement. In their application, parents must state the grounds on which they are asking for a review and the outcome which they seek. 6.3 Review Panel: The review will be undertaken by a Panel, which will consist of at least two members of the Council and a third person who is independent of the running of Cheltenham College. The Panel members will have no detailed previous knowledge of the case or of the pupil or parents. Parents will be notified in advance of the"}

A child is considered EAL if their first language (mother tongue) is not English and/or they continue to be exposed to another language in their home or community. Why we provide EAL lessons at The Prep When a child joins our school from another culture, it can be hard for them to meet the challenges of a new way of life and learn a new language. Therefore, we offer English as an Additional Language (EAL) lessons to help ensure that no child is left behind with their learning. EAL lessons can allow a pupil to fill in any gaps in their education that may have resulted from their schooling in another country or language and also gives them the opportunity to not fall behind their peers within the classroom as far as possible. It is our aim to provide our EAL pupils with the skills required to integrate as quickly as possible with their peers both socially and academically. With support, we encourage each child to fulfil their potential, by providing a supportive learning environment to prepare the pupil for the demands of the wide curriculum on offer. Organisation Pre-Prep is divided into Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS- Nursery and Reception) and Key Stage 1 (KS1 -Years 1 and 2). EAL pupils are monitored by the SENCo and supported both within class and in a 1:1 session where appropriate. EAL pupils are also supported in lessons by the class teacher and teaching assistant as required. The Learning Hub team support and monitor pupils from Year 3 to 8, and once assessed, pupils’ individual needs are catered for with the requisite number of lessons required. The lessons can be in the form of one-to-one teaching or small group teaching. Once we are aware of a pupil’s strengths and weaknesses, we are able to create a scheme of work that is individually designed to best support a child’s needs and address any gaps in their linguistic skills, be it speaking, listening, knowledge of vocabulary, reading or writing. EAL lessons are part of the Learning Support Department who make sure all needs are met, and information on pupil learning needs is available for all subject teachers to access via ISAMS and Prep Pupil Learning Hub Tracker. EAL lessons are subject supportive, and we work closely with the English Department to make sure that any potential areas of weakness are addressed at the earliest possible opportunity. These lessons also provide a chance for our pupils to tackle topics that they don’t understand and are not confident enough to address in the classroom. This allows pupils to maintain their learning and ensures they are able to access the same curriculum as their class peers as far as possible. Boarding House The children joining the boarding house are given introductory booklets. These contain pictures and words that they may need when first arriving at the Prep. This provides the children with the opportunity to translate some key vocabulary into their first language. When arriving at the Prep the children are given a map and a booklet containing pictures of their new classrooms, the map is colour coded to help the children find their way around the Prep. The Matron has regular meetings with the EAL teacher to discuss how each individual child can be supported with their learning and pastoral needs. Activities are organised to reinforce skills that our children are learning in their EAL lessons in a fun, relaxed manner in the boarding house. Transition Stages Throughout Pre-Prep, staff liaise closely with each other to aid transition, passing on key information about EAL pupils’ needs, requirements and progress. The Learning Hub liaise closely with Pre-Prep staff to help with the transition to Lower School (Year 3). They have close links with Cheltenham College EAL staff. They share good practice and resources, in order to"}

The Learning Hub liaise closely with Pre-Prep staff to help with the transition to Lower School (Year 3). They have close links with Cheltenham College EAL staff. They share good practice and resources, in order to provide the best possible service for EAL pupils across both schools. Staff meet regularly to synchronise the admissions process, and share information about pupils joining the College, to ease in pupils as seamlessly as possible. EAL provision for EYFS and Key Stage 1 Within EYFS, the aim is to support EAL pupils in gaining access to the Early Years Foundation Stage curriculum and this is done through the provision of differentiated materials, both in the child’s home language and English. In Key Stage 1, EAL pupils are supported in accessing the National Curriculum. All EAL pupils are given the opportunity to work with the SENCo on an individual basis to improve vocabulary and practise their English conversation as required. EAL Provision Years 3 to 8 EAL provision is reviewed on a termly basis. The aim is to maximise impact by arranging intervention as early as is possible. Pupils are withdrawn from a range of subjects, but always to minimise the impact on their learning in the classroom. There will also be some general in-class support provided by Teaching Assistants in English and Maths from Years 3 to 8 where appropriate, to allow EAL pupils the opportunity to seek support within the classroom. Pupils are withdrawn on a 1:1 basis, or sometimes in pairs or small groups to receive multi-sensory language teaching to develop their spoken language and to address any specific areas of difficulty in reading, spelling, writing, handwriting, listening skills, social and communication difficulties and to extend their vocabulary. The team conduct reading, vocabulary and spelling tests when necessary with 1:1 pupils to closely monitor their progress. EAL pupils are provided with individual programmes to improve and consolidate techniques in Core Subjects, Study Skills and exam techniques in preparation for their Common Entrance or Academic Scholarship goal. It is essential the required support for exams be in place, thus an Educational Psychologist or in Specialist Teacher assessment may be required to advise on this. EAL List - A register of pupils with EAL needs is maintained and updated by the SENCo and Head of EAL Meetings are held with Head of Learning Support and other school staff as required. Teaching Assistants who are supporting EAL children in class liaise with the EAL teacher to monitor how our EAL children are accessing the curriculum. Assessments for EAL pupils EYFS and KS1 Steps will have been taken on entry to the school, to find out about pupils' proficiency in their own language as well as any other languages spoken and their level of English proficiency. This will be recorded in the pupil’s file held by the SENCo and reviewed and updated at the end of every term to determine progress. EAL pupils within EYFS will be assessed as their peers using the specific framework for this age group. EAL pupils in KS1 will follow the same assessment procedures as their peers, CAT4, independent writing and phonics assessments, with extra support required for the reading of instructions if appropriate. From Year 3 through to Year 8, our assessment procedures allow us to monitor progress to ensure each child’s individual requirements are catered for. As part of our assessment procedure EAL children complete the Oxford On Line Placement Test, standardised reading, spelling and vocabulary tests are administered as required, to establish a baseline and to measure progress. Learning styles are established to inform teaching and to help children understand how they learn best. EAL pupils complete the same assessments as their peers in subject areas including class-based assessments and a range of standardised assessments (see schedule of assessment), including CAT4.

Test results are also used to inform planning and to help develop appropriate teaching programmes. Test scores are recorded on the Learning Support DIGIZONE to allow progress to be tracked. Further diagnostic assessments for handwriting, pronunciation and for dyslexia screening can be administered as required. Referrals for external advice Should a pupil not make the expected levels of progress, a referral can be made to independent external agencies, e.g. Educational Psychologist, Occupational Therapist or Speech and Language therapist. There are additional charges made for these services. Liaison with others We work closely with parents and staff, to ensure the needs of the child are met in a consistent manner. EAL List and Exam Access Arrangements List The EAL list is a working document and is updated and reissued as required. The list is created and maintained by the Head of Learning Support /SENCo and is distributed to staff regularly. Pupils are added to the list if they meet the criteria for additional support in examinations, for example the use of a Scribe, Reader, Extra Time. Eligibility is based on Exam Access Arrangements conducted assessments done in-house and on recommendations from external specialists e.g. Educational Psychologists or Specialist teachers. Access arrangements can be put in place for exams but not for in class assessments. For those EAL children who have less than three years of English in their previous schools they are given extra time and are permitted to use a dictionary if this is their normal way of working for a straight translation of unknown words. However, this only applies in Maths and Science exams. Pupils are given support and practice during their lessons in the use of these arrangements. Individual Pupil SEN/Learning support and EAL needs Information relating to pupils’ specific learning needs and their EAL needs is available to staff on Prep Pupil Learning Hub Tracker and on ISAMS. Short term plans These are stored on the Learning Support DIGIZONE each term for every EAL pupil. The plans include teaching aims and topics covered. Reports Progress reports are sent once a year to parents, in addition to multiple parent meeting opportunities throughout the year (which can be online or in person). Pupil targets These are discussed with the pupils and recorded on the Learning Hub tracker. Assessment scores Results of any assessments undertaken in EYFS or KS1 will be stored on the DIGIZONE. Class teachers will also keep a copy in their own files. The staff complete assessments as recommended by the Head of Learning Support/ SENCo (under guidance). The results should be stored on the Learning Support DIGIZONE for each pupil and kept up to date. The test papers should be retained in the pupil file if appropriate. Regular assessments completed by all pupils, including EAL pupils, are stored on the Learning Hub Tracker. Reporting EAL staff complete Assessments and Reports for pupils’ work within EAL lessons. Copies are archived on the Learning Hub Tracker. Meetings - Minutes need to be made following any significant meetings with a parent and any significant points stored on CPOMS.

The College approves of the principle of the EBacc, and all pupils will sit (I)GCSE qualifications in Mathematics, English, Science, a Modern Language and a Humanity, except where specific individual needs dictate otherwise; • Contribute effectively to the intellectual, physical, personal attainment and development of the pupils; • Give pupils experience in linguistic, mathematical, scientific, technological, human and social, physical, and aesthetic and creative education; • Teach subject matter appropriate for the ages, gender, backgrounds and aptitudes of pupils, including those pupils with an Education and Health Care Plan (EHC Plan). • Enable pupils to acquire skills in speaking, listening, literacy and numeracy, ICT and digital literacy; • Provide for personal, social and health education which reflects the College’s aims and ethos, and which promotes respect for fundamental British values and prepares pupils for British society. PSHE is evolving into a Wellbeing programme entitled ‘Floreat’. The programme across all year groups seeks to encourage tolerance and diversity, including respect for others on the basis of the protected characteristics in law; • Provide for appropriate careers and higher education guidance. Sixth Form PSHE includes a focus on leadership and economic education (e.g. student finance). Higher Education and Careers guidance is presented impartially, with no bias or favouritism towards a particular education or work option. College consciously works to prevent all forms of stereotyping in the advice and guidance provided to ensure that girls and boys from all backgrounds and diversity groups consider the widest possible range of careers, including those which are often portrayed as primarily for one or other of the sexes. The guidance enables pupils to make informed choices about a broad range of options open to them, with timely advice given to help pupils choose GCSE and post-16 courses. Careers options help to encourage all pupils to fulfil their potential. Pupils learn about different careers and opportunities, obtain individual guidance and may have work experience; • Enable pupils to acquire new knowledge and make progress according to their ability so that they increase their understanding and develop their skills in the subjects taught; • Provide Relationship and Sex Education (RSE) for all year groups as part of the Floreat programme. • Provide pupils with adequate preparation for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of adult life; 2 • Be enriched by extra- and co-curricular activities; • Offer all pupils the opportunity to explore and access their full academic potential; • Foster in pupils a sense of delight in the life of the mind and the application of intellectual, physical or creative, interest in their work, and the ability to think and learn for themselves; • Involve well-planned lessons, effective teaching methods, suitable activities and wise management of classroom time; • Show a good understanding of the aptitudes, needs and prior attainments of the pupils, and ensure that these are taken into account in the planning of lessons. Where a pupil has an EHC plan, the Deputy Head (Learning and Wellbeing) will put in place an Individual Learning Plan that responds to his or her needs. Regular meetings of the pupil’s teachers will be convened to discuss his/her progress. Several pupils whose needs are not significant enough to have an EHC plan will nevertheless benefit from an ILP, co-ordinated by the Deputy Head (Learning and Wellbeing); • Ensure that teachers possess appropriate knowledge and understanding of the subjects they teach; • Be based on classroom resources of an adequate quality, quantity and range; • Ensure regular and thorough assessment of pupils’ work; • Ensure that effective strategies are in place for managing pupil behaviour and encouraging responsible behaviour; • Be subject to on-going evaluation and review by the Council Education Committee, Head, the Academic Management Team, the Heads of Departments’ and other committees as appropriate.

The College continues to seek to raise academic attainment and achievement; to foster a strong work ethic amongst the pupils; to have high academic ambitions, manifested not only in (I)GCSE and A Level results but through co-curricular academic activities; to support lower attaining pupils, raise the attainment of middle-ability learners, and provide challenge to the higher attainers; to foster a sense of curiosity and of excitement about the world of ideas. Full details of the curriculum can be found in the various Curriculum Booklets, electronic versions of which can be found on the College website (on the ‘Academic’ tab). The timetable The College timetable is spread over six days. All pupils in 5th Form through to U6th have Games on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday afternoons. These days only contain teaching in the morning (5 periods of 40 minutes), whereas Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays also have 2 or 3 lessons of 35 minutes each in the afternoon. 3rd Form and 4th Form follow the same schedule on Thursdays and Saturdays, but on Tuesdays they have timetabled games in the morning and lessons in the afternoon.

Other subjects prefer to teach in mixed-attainment groups where pupils benefit from sharing the ideas and perspectives of a wide range of classmates. 5 At College, Mathematics, English, Science and French set pupils according to ability wherever possible, from 3rd Form onwards. The decision to place a pupil in a particular set is made to enable him or her to get the best support relative to his or her ability in the subject. Sometimes, a class teacher will feel that a pupil would be better served by changing set; this often follows assessments sat by the entire year group. Moving a pupil ‘down’ a set is never a punishment. It is only done when the teacher and the Head of Department consider that the pupil will be better supported in his or her learning by moving at a slightly slower pace. Parents are asked to trust College’s professional judgement in such matters; we do not take these decisions lightly. When a pupil changes set, the Head of Department will discuss the proposed change with the pupil so that he or she understands the reasons for moving set and will inform the Housemaster or Housemistress and the Tutor. The Tutor will then inform the parents. If parents are dissatisfied with such a decision, they are invited to contact the Deputy Head (Academic) or the relevant Head of Department. However, it should be re-emphasised that any change of set should leave a pupil in a better position to achieve, through working at a speed more appropriate to his or her ability in the subject. Reporting to parents A written report of a pupil’s progress and attainment in the main subject areas taught is provided to parents, unless a parent has agreed otherwise. Reports are provided to parents every half term, with the exception of the Fifth Form and Upper Sixth who do not receive one in the second half of the summer term, as their exams are underway. Both Fifth Form and Upper Sixth receive a Valedictory Report in the summer term. As part of the reporting process, pupils are graded for attainment / progress and Attitude to Learning. All reports are published to parents on the parent portal and parents are notified by email. Parents are informed of the grade descriptors, where applicable, and the schedule for reporting throughout the year."}

Both schools maintain a steady state of protection against infections with provision of surface cleaning materials and hand sanitising. These procedures are built into departmental risk assessments. College aligns its approach with regional or national guidance provided in the event of an infection outbreak. Guidance in these events will come from the NHS, Department for Education or Gloucestershire Director for Public Health. 3.11 Manual Handling The Manual Handling Operations Regulations (Revised 2002) primarily affects staff. Pupils should not be required to undertake manual handling operations that are beyond the capabilities of the individual. There is a duty to avoid the need for manual handling operations, that involve a risk of injury, so far as is reasonably practicable. An assessment of the risks in those manual handling operations, which cannot be avoided, should be made. Many manual handling operations take place each day around Cheltenham College. The intention is to target operations that cannot be avoided or eliminated, and which are liable to present a risk of injury and it is this category, which needs further specific assessment. Training is available for staff who undertake manual handling roles. 3.12 Working at Heights Falls from height are one of the biggest causes of workplace fatalities in the UK. The HSE defines a ‘height’ as a distance that a person could fall that would be liable to cause injury. This therefore means any height and many injuries are a result of falls from relatively low heights. Typical falling from height scenarios are; • Falls from working on a ladder or flat roof • Falling through a fragile surface • Openings in a floor or hole in the ground. The simple steps to follow for working at heights are; • To avoid working at height if it is reasonably practicable • Where work cannot be avoided, to use the right equipment or to work from an existing safe place (e.g. a balcony or walkway) or use the appropriate access equipment which is fit for purpose. Where work is undertaken you should; 12 • Do as much work from the ground, or a relatively safe place, rather than using height access equipment • Ensure workers can get safely to and from the working height • Ensure"}

Where work is undertaken you should; 12 • Do as much work from the ground, or a relatively safe place, rather than using height access equipment • Ensure workers can get safely to and from the working height • Ensure that access equipment is fit for purpose – tested and maintained • Not overload the equipment or overstretch whilst working at height • Take extra precautions on fragile surfaces (including flat roofs) • Protect persons on the ground from falling objects • Consider emergency evacuation – in the event of fire or other emergency can the workers extract themselves quickly. Height’s training is available for College staff who work at heights. 3.13 Lone working College has a duty to manage the health and safety risks of staff who work alone, this duty equally applies to contractors, self-employed staff, homeworkers, and volunteers. Lone workers are those who work by themselves, without close or direct supervision, such staff might include; • Trades people, ground staff and gardeners • Porters and Security • Housekeeping staff • Drivers • Home workers The risks for lone workers are due to the reduced level of direct supervision and that help, if required in an emergency, may be delayed. Therefore staff working in higher hazard areas, present the highest risk with regards to their safety when lone working. Such hazards could include; • Working at heights • Working in confined spaces • Working with hazardous or highly flammable materials • Electricians who are exposed to live electrical conductors • Where there is potential for conflict or even violence These activities will be the subject of a risk assessment. Where these hazards are regularly undertaken by lone workers, this risk should be addressed in the risk assessment. Contractors undertaking specified tasks will complete a permit to work either in advance or on arrival at Estates and before conducting the work. Staff should be trained to know when to ask for help when they are engaging in hazardous activities, to ensure that support and supervision can be put in place. Where workers work consistently on their own, they should know how to raise an alarm if they need emergency help and be able to perform basic first aid on themselves. Homeworkers, who work away from the workplace for extended periods, can feel isolated and may feel stressed. Line managers should monitor and keep in touch with their homeworkers. Homeworkers should have contact details for their line managers. 13 On occasions, due to the nature of the role, hazards involved, potential for isolation, or if there are underlying health conditions, it may be appropriate to undertake an individual risk assessment. The line manager and staff member should engage with this, and the Health and Safety Manager will provide guidance on the process and help identify controls. 3.14 Departmental Responsibilities Heads of Department should consider the need to access heights during their activities within the departmental risk assessment. The Health, Safety and Risk Manager can be contacted for further advice on access requirements and any associated training. 3.15 Security The layout of Cheltenham College makes it difficult to avoid a degree of access by the public. Staff and pupils are asked to remain vigilant to security threats. Suspect persons or packages should be reported immediately to Security or a senior member of College. In the meantime, if the threat is serious the alarm should be raised. The Lockdown Policy can be found on the Policy Portal. Staff must ensure their identification badge and lanyard are always visible. Staff who wear branded uniform may, for safety reasons, prefer to carry their identification card. Although checked by Night Security Team, employees and pupils must ensure that they close external doors and windows to prevent unauthorised access to all buildings, day and night. 3.16 Smoking and Vaping The Smoke-free (Premises and Enforcement) Regulations 2006"}

Although checked by Night Security Team, employees and pupils must ensure that they close external doors and windows to prevent unauthorised access to all buildings, day and night. 3.16 Smoking and Vaping The Smoke-free (Premises and Enforcement) Regulations 2006 came into effect on 1 July 2007. It is Cheltenham College policy that the entire premises (enclosed areas) and College vehicles are smoke-free; and that all employees, pupils and visitors have a right to a smoke-free environment. This policy applies to every employee, pupil, visitor, and contractor. This policy applies equally to electronic cigarettes (vaping). Staff who smoke will be informed of the timing and location of breaks by their line manager. Designated areas will be made obvious by the presence of smoking bins provided to allow smokers to safely dispose of waste smoking materials. Adequate and appropriate ‘No Smoking’ signage is clearly displayed at entrances to each building in accordance with the Smoke Free (Signs) Regulations 2012. A Smoking and Vaping Policy relevant to Pupils, produced by the DSL can be found on the Policy Portal. 3.17 Visitors and Contractors Visitors are those on site who are not employed by Cheltenham College. Visitors include temporary workers and contractors, as well as people only on site for a few hours or minutes, such as friends or family members of staff, members of the public and associates touring the site. The procedures below should be followed: • Visitors report to Main or Prep reception, signed-in, given ‘Visitor Information’ and directed to the safeguarding section and collect identity badge (always worn visibly). • Temporary workers and contractors will be directed to the appropriate reception or department of College to sign in. 14 • When a member of staff invites a visitor to College, he / she must always accompany the visitor and is responsible for their safety whilst on site. • Ensure that visitors are directed to staff and visitors’ lavatories only. • Ensure that any hazardous areas are off limits to visitors • Contractors undertaking hazardous work processes at College are asked to provide their RAMs (Risk Assessment and Method Statement) before work commences. Upon arrival they are signed in and given a ‘permit to work’. For some high-risk working or processes, Cheltenham College may ask for details of qualifications and other evidence of competency considered relevant to the safe conduct of the task. Further Information can be found in the Visitors Policy on the Policy Portal. 3.18 Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015 The Estates Bursar will seek to ensure that Cheltenham College complies with all relevant aspects of the CDM regulations 2015. It is important that all staff comply with the safety plan, in particular any restrictions on entering a site while work is in progress. 3.19 Drones Drone footage may be required by Cheltenham College for publicity or marketing purposes or for undertaking surveys of buildings, or gas, water, or electric mains. Operating and flying drones requires a high level of training, licencing, and arrangements for risk assessment and insurance. Therefore, Cheltenham College only operate drones in controlled circumstances. College operates its own drones in a controlled way with the appropriate licences, training and agreement with insurers. Otherwise a drone, will be bought in from an approved contractor. Approved drone contractors will have a Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) licence to operate, and have drone insurance and a risk assessment. Staff or pupils must not bring their drones on site without permission. Any request for pupils to use a drone (as part of their studies) or from staff, needs to be risk-assessed and approved by the Bursar or Health, Safety and Risk Manager. 3.20 Health and Safety Executive Inspections Health and safety law is enforced by inspectors from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) or by inspectors from other authorities such as the Independent Schools Inspectorate and the Fire"}

HSE Inspectors have the right to enter any workplace without giving notice, though notice may be given where the inspector thinks it is appropriate. On a normal inspection visit an inspector would expect to look at the workplace, the work activities, the management of health and safety, and to check that Cheltenham College is complying with health and safety law. The inspector may offer guidance or advice to help. They may also talk to employees and their representatives, take photographs and samples, serve improvement notices, and act if there is a risk to health and safety which needs to be dealt with immediately. 3.21 Health and Safety Executive – Fee for Interventions. HSE operates a Fee for Intervention (FFI) cost recovery scheme. Under The Health and Safety (Fees) Regulations those organisations who break health and safety laws are liable for covering the HSE’s related costs, including inspection, investigation and taking enforcement action. 15 3.22 The Health and Safety Committee and Safety Representatives 3.22.1 The Health and Safety Committee The Health and Safety Committee is chaired by the Deputy Bursar and has representative members from College and Preparatory Schools and Support. 3.22.2 Health and Safety Terms of Reference: • To maintain an overall assessment of the key Health and Safety risks in the form of a Health and Safety Development Plan, from which priorities for action are set and reviewed annually. • Where there is a significant risk, to determine and ensure action is taken to mitigate such risk. • To provide feedback and guidance to Council. • To facilitate effective communication with employees. • To approve health and safety priorities to be included in the Health and Safety Development Plan. 3.22.3 Safety representatives May be nominated from departments and they represent the department and consult the employer on health and safety matters. The safety representative or Health, Safety and Risk Manager are the first points of contact for health and safety concerns that staff may have. The safety representative does not have to be the HOD or HSM. 3.22.4 Safety representatives’ duties Although regulations give safety representatives wide powers, they impose no additional duty. Representatives are given immunity from prosecution for anything done in breach of safety law while acting as a safety representative. Please see the First Aid policy for departmental safety representatives’ duties for first aid. Safety Representatives can: • Investigate potential hazards and causes of accidents. • Investigate complaints about health and safety and welfare made by employees • Make representations to Cheltenham College about the hazards or complaints • Make representations to the employer about general matters of health, safety, or welfare • Carry out inspections of the workplace • Represent employees in consultation with inspectors of appropriate enforcing authorities • Receive information from those inspectors • Attend safety committee meetings in the capacity of a safety representative in connection with any of the above functions 3.23 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) 16 PPE is the last line of defence in protecting employees from harmful substances, processes, or conditions. However, when a residual risk remains, employees must use PPE provided, as shown by their HOD or Line Manager. To ensure suitability Cheltenham College must seek to ensure that: • The PPE is appropriate for the risks and working conditions • The needs of the employee are considered • The PPE fits the individual correctly • The PPE gives adequate protection, (including face fit testing for respiratory protective equipment, (RPE), where required) Cheltenham College will also seek to ensure that: • Where 2 or more types of PPE are used that they are compatible • An assessment"}

Where this is not reasonably practicable, the exposure shall be adequately controlled by other means. Cheltenham College will not carry out any work liable to expose staff or others to any substance hazardous to health, unless a suitable and sufficient assessment of: • The risk created by the work to the health and safety of the staff or others involved has been undertaken • The steps that need to be taken to meet the requirements of the regulations, and has implemented such steps • Whether less hazardous alternatives to the planned substance are available Each HoD is responsible for identifying substances that requires an assessment within their department. The COSHH assessment shall include consideration of: • The hazardous properties of the substance • Information on health effects provided by the supplier, including the information given on relevant safety data sheets • The level, type, and duration of exposure • The circumstances of the work, including the amount of substance involved • Activities such as maintenance, where there is the potential for high levels of exposure • Any relevant occupational exposure standard, maximum exposure limit or other similar occupational exposure limit • The effect of preventative and control measures • The results of relevant health surveillance • The results of monitoring of exposure 17 • Circumstances where work involves exposure to more than one hazardous substance, and the risk presented by exposure to such a combination • The approved classification of any biological agent • Any additional information that Cheltenham College might need to complete the assessment The COSHH assessment must be reviewed regularly and immediately when: • It is suspected that the assessment is no longer valid • There has been a significant change in the work to which the assessment relates • The results of any monitoring show it to be necessary The assessments must be recorded and displayed where all individuals likely to be involved with the substance in question may see them. Science Departments use CLEAPs guidance to provide advice on the use of chemicals in a school laboratory environment. 3.25 Radiation Sources The school holds a radiation licence and stores and uses radiation sources in accordance with the licence. A member of staff is designated and trained as the Radiation Protection Supervisor. Only experienced science staff can sign out and use the sources. A copy of the source inventory is held at the front of the Science Block for emergency services. 3.26 Water Quality including Legionellosis The Estates Bursar oversees the appropriate action of monitoring and testing for legionella bacteria throughout Cheltenham College.

IT and online communications provide unrivalled opportunities for enhanced learning in addition to traditional methods but also pose greater and more subtle risks to young people. Our pupils are therefore taught how to stay safe in the online environment and how to mitigate risks, including but not limited to, identity theft, bullying, harassment, grooming, stalking, abuse and radicalisation. This includes education on emerging threats such as misinformation, disinformation, and the ethical use of generative AI. Pupils are also made aware of the risks associated with their digital footprint, and staff are supported with updated guidance on filtering, monitoring, and safeguarding in both physical and remote learning environments. We actively encourage open communication with families to ensure pupils are supported in making safe and informed choices online, both at school and at home. New technologies are continually enhancing communication, the sharing of information, learning, social interaction and leisure activities. This policy acknowledges that online safety is as much about behaviour as it is about electronic security. This policy, supported by the ICT Acceptable Use Policies for staff and pupils is implemented to protect the interests and safety of the whole school community. It aims to provide clear guidance on how to minimise risks and how to deal with any infringements. It is linked to the following school policies: • Child Protection and Safeguarding Policy (CC) • Child on Child Abuse Policy (CC) • Staff Behaviour Code of Conduct (CC) Page 2 of 7 • Behaviour Policy (CC) • Anti-Bullying Policy (C) and (P) • Senior Pupil ICT Acceptable Use Policy (C) • Pupil Acceptable Use Policy for younger pupils (P) • Staff ICT Acceptable Use Policy (CC) • Data Protection Policy (CC) While digital technologies offer exciting and valuable opportunities both within and beyond the classroom, many online platforms and resources are not consistently monitored or regulated. It is essential that all users students, staff and visitors understand the wide range of potential risks associated with internet use and engage with these technologies responsibly and safely. At Cheltenham College, we understand the responsibility to educate our pupils on online safety issues, teaching them the appropriate behaviours and critical thinking skills necessary to enable them to remain both safe and within the law when using the internet and related technologies in and beyond the classroom. We also understand the importance of involving pupils in discussions about online safety and listening to their fears and anxieties as well as their thoughts and ideas. This is done through teachers, tutors and the Thrive! and Floreat Programmes, the schools’ wellbeing programmes and includes the KCSiE areas of focus Content, Conduct, Contact Commerce: • Contact: being subjected to harmful online interaction with other users; for example: peer to peer pressure, commercial advertising and adults posing as children or young adults with the intention to groom or exploit them for sexual, criminal, financial or other purposes. • Content: refers to the risk of children being exposed to illegal, inappropriate or harmful material online. This includes pornography, racism, misogyny, anti-Semitism, self-harm, suicide, radicalisation, extremism and violent content. Increasingly, children are also at risk from exposure to misinformation, disinformation including fake news, and conspiracy theories, which can distort their understanding of the world and influence their behaviour in harmful ways.

Increasingly, children are also at risk from exposure to misinformation, disinformation including fake news, and conspiracy theories, which can distort their understanding of the world and influence their behaviour in harmful ways. Additionally, peer driven advertising and social listening, where content is tailored based on children's online activity, can subtly manipulate their choices and pose further safeguarding concerns. • Conduct: personal online behaviour that increases the likelihood of, or causes digital self-harm or harm to others; for example, making, sending and receiving explicit images (e.g. consensual and non-consensual sharing of nudes and semi-nudes and/or pornography, sharing other explicit images and online bullying). Sharing huge amounts of personal information (e.g. Snapmaps or games on Instagram)as well as password sharing. • Commerce: risks such as online gambling, inappropriate advertising and risk of having brand ambassadors and peer to peer advertising, phishing and or financial scams. 3 Scope of this Policy This policy applies to all members of the school community, including staff, pupils, parents and visitors, who have access to and are users of the school IT systems. In this policy 'staff' includes teaching and non-teaching staff, governors, and regular volunteers. 'Parents’ includes pupils' carers and guardians. 'Visitors' includes anyone else who comes to the school, including occasional volunteers.

They ensure that suspected inappropriate use of the internet and emails by pupils are reported to the appropriate member of staff on duty and in accordance with the filtering and monitoring policy. 4.7 Teaching and support staff All staff are required to accept and follow the Staff ICT Acceptable Use Policy before accessing the school’s systems. The Staff ICT Acceptable User Policy includes the requirement for promoting the online safety of pupils. As with all issues of safety at this school, staff are encouraged to create a talking and listening culture in order to address any online safety issues which may arise in classrooms on a daily basis. 4.8 Pupils Pupils are responsible for reading, understanding and adhering to the Pupil ICT Acceptable Use Policy including the reporting of concerns and for letting staff know if they see IT systems being misused. 4.9 Parents and carers Cheltenham College believes that it is essential for parents to be fully involved with promoting online safety both in and outside of school. We regularly consult and discuss online safety with parents and seek to promote a wide understanding of the benefits and risks related to internet usage. The school will always contact parents if it has any concerns about pupils' behaviour in this area and likewise it actively encourages parents to feel able to share any concerns with the school Parents and carers are responsible for endorsing the schools’ ICT Pupil Acceptable Use Policies. 5 Education and training 5.1 Staff: awareness and training Staff receive information on Cheltenham College's online safety, ICT Acceptable Use policies, and guidelines on the responsible use of generative AI tools as part of their induction. All teaching staff receive regular updates and training on online safety, including the ethical and safe use of generative AI technologies, through INSET sessions and internal meetings. They are made aware of their individual responsibilities in safeguarding children"}

All teaching staff receive regular updates and training on online safety, including the ethical and safe use of generative AI technologies, through INSET sessions and internal meetings. They are made aware of their individual responsibilities in safeguarding children within the context of online safety and emerging digital tools. Staff working with children are responsible for promoting and modeling safe and responsible behavior, both in their classrooms and when using digital technologies, including generative AI. They must ensure adherence to school procedures that safeguard all members of the community. Page 5 of 7 Teaching staff are encouraged to integrate online safety and responsible generative AI use within their subject areas and cultivate an open culture where students can discuss digital issues as they arise. Staff should be familiar with procedures to follow in the event of technology misuse by any school community member; these are outlined in the Anti-Bullying and Child-on-Child Abuse Policy. If any incident relating to online safety or inappropriate use of generative AI occurs, staff must complete a CPOMS entry promptly. These reports are directed to the school’s designated safeguarding leads (DSLs), who will take appropriate action and liaise as necessary. 5.2 Pupils: online safety in the curriculum The use of IT and online resources is increasingly embedded across the curriculum, and we believe it is essential that pupils receive regular, meaningful guidance on how to stay safe online. We are committed to promoting online safety through a variety of approaches and continuously seek new opportunities to enhance pupils’ understanding of the digital world. Their awareness and knowledge are regularly monitored and reinforced through both formal and informal learning experiences. Online safety is taught across a range of curriculum areas, including dedicated IT lessons. In addition, pupils are educated about the risks associated with digital technologies beyond the school environment through our Thrive! and Floreat programmes, assemblies, and responsive discussions when relevant situations arise. At age-appropriate levels, pupils are taught to understand their responsibilities for staying safe online and how to protect themselves and others. From Year 5, pupils receive specific education on recognising the signs of online sexual exploitation, stalking, and grooming, as well as understanding the associated risks and their responsibility to report any concerns involving themselves or their peers. Pupils are encouraged to report any online safety concerns to the Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL) or any trusted member of staff. From Year 9, pupils are also introduced to relevant legal frameworks surrounding internet use, including data protection, intellectual property, and the importance of respecting others’ information and digital content. Pupils are made aware of the impact of cyberbullying and are taught how to seek help if they are affected. They are encouraged to speak to their tutors, teachers, pastoral staff, the DSL, parents, peers, or any member of the school community if they experience difficulties online. Further guidance on this can be found in the school’s Anti-Bullying Policy, which outlines both preventative measures and the procedures followed when incidents occur. 5.3 Parents The school seeks to work closely with parents and guardians in promoting a culture of online safety. The school will always contact parents if it has any concerns about pupils' behaviour in this area and likewise it hopes that parents will feel able to share any concerns with the school. The school recognises that not all parents and guardians may feel equipped to protect their child when they use electronic equipment at home. The school therefore arranges annual discussion events for parents when a specialist advises about online safety and the practical steps that parents can take to minimise the potential dangers to their children without curbing their natural enthusiasm and curiosity.

The school therefore arranges annual discussion events for parents when a specialist advises about online safety and the practical steps that parents can take to minimise the potential dangers to their children without curbing their natural enthusiasm and curiosity. Page 6 of 7 6 Policy Statements 6.1 Acceptable Use Policies relating to the acceptable use of information and communication technology (ICT) shall be defined, approved by management, published and communicated to all staff, pupils and relevant parties. Policies shall be differentiated and consistent, in that they recognise the age, role and the needs of users, particularly young people at different ages and stages within the schools whilst maintaining a common set of security and safety principles. These policies shall be regularly reviewed in the light of current practice, legislation and changes in technology. Acceptable use policies shall define a wide range of rules relating to both security and online safety including: • Online and social media, including activities inside and outside school. • Promoting online safety e.g. the supervision of pupil online safety of pupils by staff and the reporting of online safety incidents. • Communication with pupils and parents by staff. • The use of technology, including protecting devices and data. • The use of digital and video images and online publishing. • Fair use of shared resources. • The retention of data and the protection of private information. • Working or learning remotely. • Personal use. • Use of personal devices. • Password Security. • Incident Reporting. 6.2 Education and training The education of pupils and staff on online safety shall be planned, developed, delivered and regularly reviewed for its effectiveness and impact. 6.3 Filtering and Monitoring Access shall be blocked to illegal, unlawful terrorist and extremist online content via the school provided internet connectivity, in accordance with the IWF CAIC list. Pupil access to online content via the school provided internet connectivity is blocked after 10.30pm at night. Filtering logs shall be regularly reviewed and breaches acted upon. All users shall be aware of, and internet use shall be monitored for lawful purposes including, but not limited to, testing the security of the systems (e.g. penetration testing), detecting compromises to the security of the system (e.g. hacking), detecting misconduct (e.g. fraud), keeping children safe in education and preventing extremism (e.g. pupil online safety) and in support of criminal investigations. Monitoring logs and alerts shall be reviewed and acted upon in a timely manner by a member of the DSL team. Pupils who are being monitored by the Welfare Management Team or are on the Pupils of Concern list would be considered a high priority pupil and acted upon accordingly. A search that triggers a high priority response would be entered on CPOMs unless the search is, after investigation, deemed safe. Page 7 of 7 Filtering and monitoring shall be implemented in a way that recognises the age, role and the changing needs of users, particularly young people at different ages and stages within the schools whilst providing the required access to content. Changes to the filtering and monitoring systems shall be strictly controlled and implemented at times that minimise the risk of disruption to the school day. The continuing, effective filtering of illegal, unlawful terrorist and extremist online content must be verified as part of the change process, alongside adequate verification that the change itself was successfully implemented and did not adversely affect other filtering and monitoring system functionality. The College’s Filtering and Monitoring Committee meet termly to reassess the effectiveness of filtering and monitoring provisions. 6.4 Data and Security A set of policies of procedures shall be maintained that ensures the school’s ongoing compliance with data protection legislation and the effective protection of personal data. All users shall be educated in these policies and procedures. The school shall protect the security of its systems, data and users by implementing and maintaining a suite of information security controls that reduce information security risk to as low a level that is reasonably practical. The school shall"}

If the school discovers that a child or young person is at risk as a consequence of online activity, it may seek assistance from Child Exploitation and Online Protection advisors. Incidents of misuse or suspected misuse must be dealt with by staff in accordance with Cheltenham College’s policies and procedures, in particular the Child Protection and Safeguarding Policy (CC). The school will impose a range of sanctions on any pupil who misuses technology to bully, harass or abuse another pupil in line with our Anti-Bullying and Behaviour Policy. 8 Complaints As with all issues of safety at Cheltenham College, if a member of staff, a pupil or a parent / carer has a complaint or concern relating to online safety, prompt action will be taken to deal with it. Complaints should be addressed to the Designated Safeguarding Lead (Noll Jenkins at The Prep and Michelle Lucas-Halliwell at College) in the first instance, who will liaise with relevant members of staff as needed and undertake an investigation where appropriate. Please see the Complaints Policy for further information. Incidents of or concerns around online safety will be recorded and reported to the school's Designated Safeguarding Lead, in accordance with the school's Child Protection and Safeguarding Policy."}

However, if parents do have a complaint, they can expect it to be treated by Cheltenham College in accordance with this policy. This policy refers to complaints and concerns, although both will be managed in the same way through this policy. This policy has been approved by the Head and Cheltenham College Council. It provides guidelines for handling concerns and complaints. It complies with the Education (Independent School Standards) Regulations 2014. The policy applies to all sections of Cheltenham College including our EYFS (Early Years Foundation Stage) setting. The procedures set out below may be adapted as appropriate to meet the policy aims and circumstances of each case. This policy applies to parents of pupils at Cheltenham College which includes a legal guardian or education guardian. Where pupils have left the College, this parents’ complaints policy no longer applies. Where repeated attempts are made by a parent to raise the same complaint after it has been considered at all three stages, this can be regarded as vexatious and outside the scope of the policy. Concerns and complaints directly from pupils are dealt with under a separate procedure, a copy of which can be supplied on request. This policy does not apply to pupil exclusion which is covered by the Suspension and Exclusion Policy. We aim to resolve any complaint in a timely manner. Timescales for each stage are set out below in the relevant paragraphs. When we refer to \"working days\" we mean Monday to Friday, during term time. The dates of terms are published on the Cheltenham College website. Who should you contact? 2 Stage 1 - Informal Resolution It is to be hoped that most concerns can be expressed and resolved on an informal basis. For a minor day-to-day issue, please contact the relevant teacher, tutor or, if it is an issue to do with boarding, the housemaster or housemistress. For a more serious subject-related academic concern, the Head of Department should be contacted. For a more serious general academic concern or pastoral matter, the housemaster or housemistress. For concerns relating to boarding please contact the Deputy Head (Pastoral) or the housemaster or housemistress in the relevant school. For concerns about the curriculum, please contact the Deputy Head (Academic) at the relevant school. For any other pastoral or disciplinary concerns, please contact the Deputy Head (Pastoral) at the relevant school. Complaints concerning the Head of Cheltenham Prep should be addressed to the Head of Cheltenham College. Complaints about the Head of College should be addressed to the President of Council by email to president@cheltenhamcollege.org. In either case, the complaint will follow the procedure set out in Stage 2. In matters regarding finance, fees and non-academic services please contact the Bursar. Cheltenham College does all it can to ensure that it responds to concerns in a highly professional manner. However, if you feel that an expression of concern has not been handled properly by a member of staff, please contact the relevant Deputy Head at either school. The member of staff concerned makes a written record of every concern; this record includes the date on which the concern was received. Cheltenham College usually endeavours to acknowledge a written notification by telephone, e-mail or letter within two working days of receipt during term time, and within seven working days or as soon as practicable in the School holidays. Should the matter not be resolved within a reasonable period (one not normally exceeding two term-time weeks) or in the event that the relevant staff and the parents fail to reach a satisfactory resolution, parents should proceed to make a formal written complaint directly to the Head using the procedure set out in Stage"}

What to do if you remain dissatisfied: Stage 2- Formal Resolution If the complaint cannot be resolved on an informal basis, then the parents should put their complaint in writing to the Head. (Complaints concerning the Head of Cheltenham Prep should be addressed to the Head of College. Complaints about the Head of College should be addressed to the President of Council by email to president@cheltenhamcollege.org) You should send full written details of the nature of the complaint, any relevant documents and full contact details. It would be very helpful if you could also indicate what you envisage as the desired outcome. Cheltenham College usually endeavours to acknowledge a written notification by telephone, email or letter within two working days of receipt during term time, and within seven working days or as soon as practicable in the School holidays. Where the complaint concerns the Head, the President of Council will replace the Head in the procedure outlined below. The Head decides, after considering the complaint, upon the appropriate course of action to take and may ask to meet with the parents, normally within ten days of receiving the formal complaint. The Head will decide on whether an investigation is appropriate. It may be necessary for the Head to carry out further investigations that may delay a resolution. The Head may ask a senior member of staff to act as investigator and may involve 3 one or more members of the Council if appropriate. Written records are kept of all meetings and interviews held in relation to the complaint. Once the Head is satisfied that, so far as is practicable, all the relevant facts have been established, the Head will reach a decision, and parents informed of this decision in writing (usually within 14 working days after meeting with the Parents). The Head will also give reasons for the decision. (The Head of Cheltenham Prep may consult with the Head of College before making a final decision.) Cheltenham College aims to respond to any written complaint within 28 days or as soon as is reasonably practicable. Stage 3 - Panel Hearing Where the parents are not satisfied with the response to the complaint made under Stage 2, they may request a review of the Stage 2 decision by the Complaints Panel at a panel hearing. The role of the Complaints Panel is to make findings and recommendations in relation to the complaint. The Complaints Panel will base its decision on documents provided by the parents and the Head, and on any oral or written comments made to the Panel. The Complaints Panel will decide on the balance of probabilities (that is, whether it is more likely or not any facts put forward are true) whether each complaint should be fully or partly upheld or dismissed. For the avoidance of doubt, the Panel will not consider any new areas of complaint which have not been previously raised as part of the Complaints procedure. In order to proceed to a panel hearing, the parents should write to the President in confidence c/o the Secretary to Council. Parents should make the request within seven days of the decision made under Stage 2 above. In their written request to the Secretary to Council, parents must state the grounds upon which they are requesting the panel hearing and the desired outcome together with all relevant documents. The Secretary to Council shall acknowledge receipt of the request for a panel hearing within five working days if possible but within seven working days and will immediately inform the President of Council and the Head that a request"}

Parents should make the request within seven days of the decision made under Stage 2 above. In their written request to the Secretary to Council, parents must state the grounds upon which they are requesting the panel hearing and the desired outcome together with all relevant documents. The Secretary to Council shall acknowledge receipt of the request for a panel hearing within five working days if possible but within seven working days and will immediately inform the President of Council and the Head that a request for a Panel Hearing has been received. The Secretary to Council shall, in consultation with the President of Council, arrange for a Panel Hearing to take place as soon as practicable and normally no later than 21 days from receipt of the request or as soon as possible. The parents will be given not less than three working days' notice of the date, place and timing of the panel hearing. The Complaints Panel will consist of three individuals who were not directly involved in the matters detailed in the complaint. One member will be independent of the management and running of Cheltenham College. The two others will be members of Council. The parents may ask the Secretary to Council to inform them who has been appointed to sit on the Complaints Panel ahead of the panel hearing. The parents and the Head (or President if the matter was dealt with by the President at Stage 2) are responsible for ensuring that they provide the Secretary to Council with copies of any material upon which they intend to rely at least seven working days before the panel hearing. If the Complaints Panel deems it necessary, it may require that further particulars of the complaint or any related matter be supplied in advance of the hearing. The Secretary to Council will ensure that at least three calendar days before the Hearing a copy of any documentation provided by the parties is provided to all present at the hearing. 4 The parents may be accompanied at the Panel Hearing by one other person e.g. a relative or friend. The hearing is not legal proceedings and the Panel are free to decide on the most appropriate procedure to be followed in the circumstances. Legal representation is not normally appropriate. If the parents wish to be accompanied by a person who is legally trained, they must inform the Secretary to Council no later than seven days before the date of the hearing to allow other parties to seek legal advice as necessary. If the parents decide not to attend the panel hearing it will be conducted in their absence using such material and representations as are available. The Panel Hearing will be conducted in an informal manner and as determined by the Chair of the Panel who will explain the procedure to all present at the beginning of the panel hearing. A note-taker will be present at the panel hearing. All those attending the hearing are expected to show courtesy, restraint and good manners. The Chair may, at his or her discretion, adjourn or terminate the hearing if these expectations are not met. If the hearing is terminated, the panel will still reach a conclusion. It is not within the powers of the Complaints Panel to make any financial award, nor to impose sanctions on staff, pupils or parents. The Complaints Panel may make recommendations to the College on these matters or any other issues as appropriate. The Panel will confirm their decision in writing to the parents and the reasons for it within seven working days of the panel hearing. The Panel's findings and any recommendations are sent in writing to the parents, the Head, Members of Council and, where relevant, the person(s) about whom the complaint was made. The decision of the Panel is final. The findings and recommendation are available for inspection on the school premises by the Council and the Head.

The record identifies those complaints relating to Cheltenham College's boarding provision. The number of formal complaints registered during the preceding school year will be supplied to parents on request. Parents can be assured that all concerns and complaints are treated seriously and confidentially. Correspondence, statements and records are kept confidential except in so far as is required of the College by the Education (Independent Schools Standards) Regulations 2014; where disclosure is required by the Secretary of State or a body conducting an inspection under section 109 of the Education and Skills Act 2008; or where any other legal obligation prevails. In accordance with data protection principles, details of individual complaints will be kept for as long as is considered to be reasonably necessary in the circumstances. There were three complaints that proceeded beyond the informal stage during the 2023/24 academic year. Contacting Ofsted or the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) Although Cheltenham College is inspected by ISI, an independent organisation which reports to the Government on schools, parents of children in the EYFS setting have the right to contact Ofsted if they have a complaint that has not concluded to their satisfaction 5 through Cheltenham College's procedure. Such parents can report their concerns to Ofsted on 0300 123 4666 at enquiries@ofsted.gov.uk.

These schools are supported by a number of the town’s important organisations – Cheltenham Festivals, The Cheltenham Trust, the National Cyber Security Centre, Cheltenham Christian Arts Festival, Gloucestershire County Council, Cheltenham Borough Council and the Diocese of Gloucester. The structure of CEP includes a Steering Group and an Operations Group. The full-time CEP Coordinator chairs the Operations Group meetings and leads the administration, planning and delivery of the Programme of Activities. The aims of CEP, to which College has invested professional staff time and financial support, are as follows: Ensure the best interests of young people are at the heart of education initiatives in Cheltenham. Provide outstanding educational opportunities for young people in Cheltenham. Reach out to all young people with potential regardless of social, economic or educational background. Provide stimulating professional development for teachers and update areas of knowledge, understanding, skills and attitudes.

The mission of The Talent Tap is to support students from less advantaged backgrounds to access opportunities, support and networks which they are unable to gain through their own home environments. Since 2017 College has sponsored 12 students from All Saint’s Academy to access Talent Tap’ multi-year programme (training, introductions, coaching and internships). Community Action Programme College continues to strive to awaken in our pupils an awareness of the social context of the all-round education they receive. The overriding aim is to connect our pupils with communities of disadvantage, deprivation or disability. The Community Action Program (CAP) continues to offer a strong presence within the locality of Cheltenham. Over fifty pupils from Year 12 took part in the program in a variety of settings including visits to Care Homes, Schools and Cotswold Riding for the Disabled. We continue to offer a number work experience places at the Cheltenham General Hospital for those Upper Sixth pupils who wish to study medicine at university. This has been invaluable for them and their personal statements, giving them experience of working in a hospital setting. In service week (June 2022) a group of 14 Year 10 pupils completed a Community Action Project based at a local Animal Shelter. The brief was to help the team at the shelter to get ready for their annual Open Weekend. College continues to work with local charities and educational bodies in our ongoing endeavours to widen public access to the schooling we provide. Our sports facilities, including the Swimming Pool, are made available to local primary schools at minimal cost. Charitable Fundraising At the start of the academic year 2021-22 the Pupil Leadership Team (PLT) elected to support the work of Pied Piper Appeal, a local (Gloucestershire) charity. A variety of fundraising events were organised by the PLT, including a whole school Colour run. In addition, pupils pledged to continue supporting the charity ‘Active Impact’, a Gloucestershire based disability charity. At year’s end, the total raised for The Pied Piper Appeal was in excess of £11,000 whilst a further £4,000 had been raised for Active Impact. In the Summer term of 2022, Houses collected non-perishable food for the foodbank of Cheltenham Open Door (over 600 items were donated). In response to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, a concert was held in Chapel with College pupils performing alongside nationally renowned musicians. Donations in lieu of tickets were made to the DEC and this event raised in excess of £6,000. Supporting International Schools During 2021-22 College donated £16,100 from its Humanitarian Aid fund towards supporting schools and pre-school centres in Nepal, Kenya, South Africa and Romania. Our main focus is to: Offer educational opportunities to disadvantaged children Contribute to building and renovation work Fundraise for specific projects Monitor achievements and performance.

An email counts as “in writing” provided that an acknowledgement of receipt is received. 1.4 ‘Subvention’ means a discount to the fees resultant from the award of a scholarship or exhibition for academic, music or sporting excellence or any other reduction to the fees such as a means-tested bursary. 1.5 Payments will comprise: - The non-refundable registration fee that is payable on completion of the Registration form; - The Final Acceptance fee, which includes a deposit and a contribution to the College pupil hardship fund; this fee is fully refundable until 18 months prior to pupil arrival, after which it will become subject to the terms set out in this document; - A Deposit “top-up”when moving from the Prep to the Senior school - Termly fees, trip costs, and any extras added to the fees from time to time. 1.6.

Other than certain exempt activity (Nursery fees, separately charged school trips for example) VAT will be added to all fees, and most additional items added to bills (extras). If the College at any time assesses (or HMRC at any time determines) that any of the services supplied by the Collee under this contract are subject to VAT, and the College has not already charged VAT on the applicable fees for those services, the College will promptly notify parents and confirm the amount of VAT payable in respect of the relevant fees. Such additional VAT should be paid within 21 days. 1.7. Our contract with you The Final Acceptance Form, the Schedule of Fees, the Admissions and Information Booklet, the joining information booklet and these Parental Terms and Conditions (as amended from time to time) form the terms of the contract between you and the College. 2.

Pupils seeking Sixth Form places will additionally be required to gain a minimum of 5 ‘Level 6’ grades at GCSE or the equivalent 2.4 Admissions into the Sixth Form for pupils already within College is governed by the conditions laid out in Clause 12.2 and 12.3. 2.5 The Final Acceptance Fee, comprising a deposit and a bursary contribution, is to be paid on Final Acceptance of a place. Full details may be found in the Admissions and Information Booklet/Joining Information booklet. The net deposit will be credited, without payment of interest, against the pupil’s final bill at College. 2.6 The College reserves the right to require a banker’s reference and/or an additional deposit, which will normally be a full term’s fees, for international pupils. International pupils are defined as living outside the UK and/or not in possession of a UK Passport. 2.7 If you do not wish to take up your child’s place at College after submitting the Final Acceptance Form, then a full term’s notice is required. In these circumstances, the Final Acceptance fee is non-refundable unless the offer of a place is withdrawn by College. In the event that you wish to cancel acceptance of a place on giving less than a term’s notice, then fees in lieu will be payable in accordance with Clause 8.2. These requirements also apply to those pupils transferring into Year 9 in the Senior School from Cheltenham College Preparatory School who have formally accepted a Year 9 place. 2.8 Preference for Houses and status (Boarding, Day Boarding, Day), may be expressed on Registration or Final Acceptance of a place. College will endeavour to meet all such preferences but reserves the right to make an alternative allocation if these cannot be met for any reason. No House or status (Boarding, Day Boarding or Day) preference is deemed as having been confirmed unless written confirmation has been received from the Admissions Office. 2.9 College reserves the right to withdraw the offer of a place where financial sanctions have been applied to those responsible for paying the fees. Those sanctions include those that derive from EU regulations, from HMRC and other bodies with a remit to oversee movement of funds across borders. 3 CHANGE OF STATUS 3.1 A pupil may, in exceptional circumstances, change status from Boarding or Day Boarding to Day at the discretion of the Head and subject always to availability of a place. Any such change will normally only take place at the beginning of the academic year. A minimum of one full terms’ notice is required. 3.1 A pupil may change status at any time from Day or Day Boarding to Boarding if places are available. 3.2 The College reserves the right to change a pupil’s House where the circumstances warrant it and following consultation with the parents. Requests for change of House are not normally permitted but requests on clear welfare grounds will be considered. 3.3 A written request for any change of status must be made to the Head, whose decision on such a change will be final. In all cases, new entrants to College will normally be given preference. Written confirmation from the Head is required before any change of status is deemed to have been agreed. 3.4 The Head may at their discretion require a change in status of a pupil (from boarding to day for example) if the Head considers it to be in the best interests of the child, or other children in the College. 4 AIMS 4.1 College aims to educate pupils in a proper manner with regard to their ability and needs.

College’s aims and ethos, whilst not contractually binding, are described in the Prospectus and can be found on the College website. 4.1 College will, as far as reasonably practicable, keep parents informed on a regular basis of a pupil’s progress and will notify them if a pupil is not progressing as well as would reasonably be expected. College will enter pupils for public examinations only if the Head is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the pupil. 4.2 The College must constantly respond to new educational needs and the challenges of society and will develop its facilities and curriculum accordingly. Whilst a pupil is at the College, there will inevitably be changes, many on a modest scale, and occasionally more fundamental. College will always keep parents advised of developments and give them reasonable advance notice when major developments are proposed. 4.3 We will exercise reasonable skill and care in the provision of our services. This will apply during school hours and at other times when your child is permitted to be on College premises or participating in activities organised by the College. The College cannot accept responsibility for your child when off College premises and not under the direct supervision of a member of staff. 4.4 If your child requires urgent medical attention while under the College’s care, we will take action (for example contact emergency services), after which we will try to contact parents (or guardians) or other emergency contacts. We will share any information that we hold about your child with appropriate medical professionals and, where necessary, we will deal with decisions about your child’s medical treatment in accordance with the advice of the treating medical professional. 5 CONDUCT, DRESS, APPEARANCE AND LEAVE OF ABSENCE ETC. 5.1 All pupils shall be subject to and abide by the policies laid down by College which concern amongst other themes conduct, dress, appearance, and leave of absence. Parents are expected to support College and ensure pupils comply with these policies. In all circumstances prior approval must be given for pupils to be absent from College, unless due to illness. 5.2 Parents should read the Parent Code of Conduct and are expected to cooperate with the College and maintain a constructive relationship with staff. Parents should act reasonably in their communication with the College ensuring the tone, content, volume and/or nature of communications are appropriate and courteous. Parents should keep the College informed in a timely manner of any matters which might affect their child, and should encourage their child in his or her studies and provide appropriate support at home. 6 FEES 6.1 Fees, day boarding supplements and insurances are due and payable termly in advance either on or before the first day of term. Other additional charges for extras are payable termly in arrears. Payments are required to be made by a single termly direct debit, at the commencement of each term. Payment of fees by any other method should be agreed in advance of the commencement of the academic year with the Bursar, initially through the fees department (see 6.6 below). Such payments will incur a nominal charge each term and may incur interest. 6.2 Fees are normally reviewed once a year. Any increase in fees will usually take effect from the start of the Autumn Term. In any case, a full term’s notice will normally be given, on the intention to increase fees without any other of these terms and conditions being affected. 6.3 Any extra-curricular activities such as private music lessons, trips and visits shall be deemed to be additional to items met by the fees and will be charged for accordingly.

In particular, all public examination charges incurred by College, and those costs incurred in providing for the special educational needs of your child outside of the normal curriculum, shall be charged as additional to the fees. 6.4 The liability to pay fees is the joint responsibility of each person who has signed the Final Acceptance Form. This liability extends to parents who may be separated/divorced. Court orders and other arrangements between parents and third parties do not normally bind or apply to the College, and do not extinguish either parent from responsibility for payment of fees. A parent can be removed from their responsibilities under this contract but that parent must obtain the prior approval of the other parent and the College in order to do so. 6.5 The College is entitled to require that notice of withdrawal must be given by both parents within the specified time frame. 6.6 Payment of fees by instalment shall be by direct debit unless agreed otherwise by the Bursar (via the fees department). In certain circumstances, fees paid by instalment may need to be via a regulated credit agreement with interest charged. The College reserves the right to cancel any agreed payment variation if payment dates are not met. Families from outside the UK are expected to use Flywire for payment of fees. 6.7 The College supports parents in using Government funding for Early Years places. Where parents are required to complete forms to secure such funding, it is incumbent on the parents to do so. The College will pass back to parents any costs which arise from failure to complete the administrative processes required by Government agencies. 6.8 Any costs of clearance of non-sterling payments or overseas cheques will be charged to Parents’ accounts. 6.9 Any costs associated with Visa renewal will be charged to Parents’ accounts. 6.10 Fees are non-refundable in respect of any period of non-attendance at College. No reduction of fees will be made in respect of any periods spent at home including study leave or stays at home following examinations. College does however offer an optional pupils’ fees refund insurance scheme. 6.11 Scholarships, bursaries and other subvention awards apply to basic fees only and not to the Day Boarding supplement or any other additional charges. 6.12 There is a sibling discount scheme at the College, which applies to families who put three of more children through the College for 5 years or more (if all three children are not at the College simultaneously, older siblings must have done at least 5 years in the school). While the College will endeavour to identify eligibility, the responsibility for confirming eligibility rests with the parents, and retrospective sibling discount will not be applied. 7 UNPAID FEES 7.1 Interest will be charged on overdue balances at the rate published by College from time to time. The current rate is published in the Admissions and Information Booklet/Joining Information booklet. 7.2 All costs incurred in the collection of unpaid fees including administrative costs and any costs and disbursements paid to solicitors or debt collection agents acting on behalf of College shall be recoverable in full. 7.3 The College reserves the right to suspend or require the withdrawal of a pupil from College where there are unpaid fees. No notice period is required, although parents will be given reasonable opportunity to discuss their situation with the College. Parents will remain responsible for the fees that apply to such periods, if the pupil removal is due to non-payment of fees. 7.4 Where additional trips are organised for which an additional fee is payable, such trips will only"}

A full term’s fees in lieu of such notice will otherwise be charged. Notice by email must be given to head@cheltenhamcollege.org for pupils in the senior school, and to prephead@cheltenhamcollege.org for prep school pupils. 8.2 Cancellation of a place once accepted, must be given in writing to College. One term’s fees, less any deposits already held, will be payable by parents in lieu of notice in the event that they cancel their Final Acceptance of a place less than a term before entry, or in the event that a pupil does not enter College after a place has been accepted. Particular cases of serious illness, injury or genuine hardship may be considered if requested in writing. Parents who cancel a place more than a full term in advance will not be required to pay fees in lieu of notice. Under these circumstances, the Final Acceptance Fee will be retained by College. 8.3 Fees in lieu of notice will not be payable in the event that College withdraws its offer of a place for any reason. Under these circumstances, any deposits held would be repayable in full, with the exception of the Registration Fee, which is, under all circumstances, non-refundable. 8.4 Extra-curricular activities for which there is an extra charge, may only be discontinued at the end of an academic term. A full term’s notice is required in writing, and in the absence of such notice, the appropriate full term’s fee will be charged in lieu. In relation to music lessons, half a term’s notice is required. 8.5 Fees in lieu of notice are a debt and College will not be required to mitigate its loss or give credit for any mitigation or for the fact that the place is subsequently filled. Under no circumstances will College disclose details of its waiting lists or other such confidential information. Fees payable in lieu of notice shall be at the rate, which applies to the term in question, as set out in the Fees Invoice. 9 POLICIES AND PROTOCOLS 9.1 Parents and pupils are expected to adhere to the policies and protocols of College, the majority of which are available on the Information section of the College website: www.cheltenhamcollege.org. Copies of policies and protocols are also available from the College Reception upon request. Policies and protocols are subject to amendment and addition from time to time. 9.2 All parents resident abroad must appoint a nominated educational guardian in the United Kingdom to act in loco parentis for them. The guardian must be British or have permanent settled status, must hold accreditation from the Association for the Education and Guardianship of International Students, must not be a student and must be a minimum of 25 years of age. The choice of guardian is the responsibility of the parent and College expects the arrangement to meet all the requirements laid out in the College’s Guardianship Policy, a copy of which can be found on the College website. College staff are not permitted to be guardians. 9.3 Parents will be informed, in good time, of any short overnight trips in term time, including costs, practical and emergency arrangements but no further written consent will be"}

College staff are not permitted to be guardians. 9.3 Parents will be informed, in good time, of any short overnight trips in term time, including costs, practical and emergency arrangements but no further written consent will be sought. Such trips might include short field study trips or attendance at a national level in a sports fixture, or other trips as College might from time to time arrange. Prior consent will not be sought where a charge of £50 or less is to be added to the fee account. 9.4 Parents consent, with the signing of these Terms and Conditions, to the testing of their child for drugs in accordance with the Controlled Drugs Policy in place at the time. A copy of this policy can be found on the College’s website. 9.5 The College may, subject to applicable data protection legislation, monitor the online activities of pupils. We may do this for various reasons, including to ensure compliance with the College rules, or where it is appropriate or necessary in connection with legal and/or other duties or other legitimate purposes. 9.6 The Head may, and his/her discretion, withdraw an offer of a place, where it is deemed not to be in the best interests of Cheltenham College to admit a pupil. 10 PROPERTY College reserves the right to invoice loss of and damage to College property as and when it arises. 11 INSURANCE 11.1 All pupils must be covered by a personal accident insurance policy to cover them for permanent disability or death resultant from an accident. College arranges this on a group basis for all pupils and this is included in the fees. 11.2 College’s insurance arrangements do not provide cover for pupils’ laptops or any other personal possessions or personal property. Parents should make their own arrangements for insurance. 11.3 Fee protection insurance is available and parents should arrange this with the fees department. 12 TERMINATION BY COLLEGE 12.1 The acceptance and continued attendance of a pupil at College is at the discretion of the Head and the College Council and College reserves the right to take back the offer of a place or require a pupil to leave College at any time. This will normally be on a term’s notice save the circumstances set out below. 12.2 Entry or continuance of a pupil into the Lower Sixth, regardless of whether a pupil is new to the school or not, is conditional upon the pupil achieving College’s academic standards including 5 Grade 6’s or above, or the equivalent thereof at GCSE, or at the discretion of the Head, taking into account the conditions within Clause 12.3. 12.3 Continuance into the Sixth Form for pupils already within the College is dependent on a pupil displaying a positive attitude towards learning, academic progress and good behaviour during his/her time in Lower College. As for new entrants to College, for those entering the Sixth Form , College is looking nominally at an equivalent minimum Sixth Form entry level of 5 Grade 6’s. Most pupils achieve much higher. Selection of some A Level subjects requires a minimum GCSE grade, likely to be a Grade 7 or even 8 or 9. Where College is concerned that an existing pupil is falling beneath the standards required for Sixth Form entry, it will contact parents formally following the Fourth Form examinations to warn that he or she may not, without improvement, be admitted to the Sixth Form. Close monitoring will then ensue during Fifth Form and, in particular, following Mock Examinations in January of the GCSE year, to enable College to make an informed decision about suitability for A Level study. 12.4 The Head may, at his/her discretion require the removal or suspension or in serious or persistent cases, expulsion of a pupil from College with immediate effect if it is considered"}

It is for the Head to decide on removal of a pupil where in his/her opinion it is in College’s best interests, that of the pupil in question or other pupils. 12.5 The Head may at his/her discretion require the removal or suspension or, in serious or persistent cases, expulsion of a pupil from College with immediate effect if the behaviour of either or both parents is, in the opinion of the Head, unreasonable and affects or is likely to affect adversely the pupil’s or other pupils’ progress at College or the wellbeing of College staff or to bring College into disrepute. 12.6 Should the Head exercise his/her right under Clauses 11.4 and 11.5, there will be no refund of fees for the balance of the term in which the suspension or expulsion occurs, though in this instance, no charge will be made for a term’s fees in lieu of notice. 12.7 The College will expect each pupil to made reasonable progress from one year to the next. The Head may at his/her discretion require the removal of a pupil from the College if progress is not satisfactory. Support will be provided by the College before taking this difficult step. 12.8 College will act in a way which is fair in all circumstances when taking these decisions. If a Parent is unhappy with the decision to expel a pupil, they should refer to the Suspension and Exclusion Policy. 12.9 College reserves the right to undertake appropriate checks on current and future parents to ensure that they are not subject to any financial or other sanctions whether in the UK or worldwide. Such sanctions may include those derived from EU Regulations, directions issued by HM Treasury and/or United Nations Security Council resolutions. In the event that such sanctions have been imposed on a parent [or related feepayer] College reserves the right to seek advice from the appropriate regulating authority concerning the sanctioned individual. Such advice will be taken into account when deciding on whether the child/children of the sanctioned individual can, as appropriate, be accepted as a possible new pupil(s) to College or can remain as a pupil. Parents must at all times cooperate with such checks by providing all necessary information. 12.10 College does not accept payment of fees or any other charges by way of cash. In ordinary circumstances College would expect fees to be paid by the Parents of a pupil as set out in the Final Acceptance Form. College recognise that it is not unusual for certain direct relatives such as grandparents to pay the fees. However, College has obligations under the UK’s Anti-money laundering provisions to make enquiries as to the source of funds when the payment of fees is made by a party or parties seemingly unconnected with the pupil concerned. In such circumstances College expects to receive full cooperation from the pupil’s parents in identifying the source of funds. In the absence of such cooperation, College reserves the right to take appropriate action to ensure it complies with relevant legislation. 13 PUPILS’ HEALTH 13.1 Parents are required to inform the Head in writing if: 13.1.1 A pupil contracts any infectious disease or illness, in which case the pupil must not be allowed to return to College whilst infectious or contagious. 13.1.2 Any medical condition is present or develops which requires particular medical or other supervision. 13.2 There is a College Medical Officer and pupils may be required to have a medical examination on entering College. The Head may at any"}

The Head may at any time require that a pupil has a medical examination for the purpose of producing a medical report. This may include the giving of a biological sample to test for the use of illegal substances. 13.3 Parents are required to complete a College Medical form prior to their child joining the school. College reserves the right to refuse admission to any pupil for whom it does not have a complete form, or where the information given is incorrect or false and there is legitimate medical cause for substantial concern subject always to the requirements of the Equality Act 2010. 14 SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS Parents are required to inform the Head immediately in writing of any Court Order affecting a pupil. 15 SPECIAL NEEDS College provides a range of support for pupils with learning difficulties or special educational needs. Pupils requiring additional tuition will incur an additional fee. 16 EMAIL AND INTERNET USE Pupils’ use of e-mail and the internet must be in accordance with College policy. College reserves the right to intercept, monitor and record communications, where necessary, for lawful purposes. Parents and pupils should be aware that breaches of the ICT Acceptable Use Policy, and in particular those parts relating to cyber-bullying, that occur during the school holidays may be considered a school matter. 17 CONFIDENTIALITY AND DATA PROTECTION 17.1 College will process all personal data in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018. 17.2 College will from time to time wish to make use of media images of pupils in College publications and via our social media channels and website. Image consent forms will be issued at the start of your child’s education at Cheltenham. Images will be used in accordance with the Photography and Film Policy. 17.3 More information regarding how personal data is used, retained, accessed, and shared with approved third parties can be found within the Privacy Notice for Pupils, Parents and Guardians, and Cheltonian Society members. 17.4 During your child’s education at College we will request your consent prior to signing pupils up to specific online educational learning resources and tools. In addition, it is in our legitimate interest to assess their academics progress using nationally recognised standardised assessments for school. Where College uses third party services for this purpose, parents should be aware of the following terms: • Where the external submission of pupil data is required, it will always be processed securely in line with Data Protection legislation. • The Centre for Evaluation and Monitoring (CEM), GL Assessment and Lucid Exact, in addition to providing the service as detailed above, may use pupil data for secondary research purposes (for example to inform national educational policy). However, any data used for this purpose will be anonymised; neither the pupil nor College will be identified. For more information, please refer to their respective websites, where they provide comprehensive Privacy Notices. 18 FORCE MAJEURE In this agreement, ‘force majeure’ shall mean any cause beyond a party’s control (including for the avoidance of doubt, strikes, other industrial disputes, act of God, war, riot, civil commotion, compliance with any law or governmental order, rule regulation or direction {including that of a local authority}, accident, fire, flood, storm, pandemic or epidemic of any disease, terrorist attack, chemical or biological contamination).

Although I have only been in this post since February, everywhere I look I see the essence of what it means to be a Cheltonian at Cheltenham Muscat. The five Cheltenham characteristics are already prevalent in all that we are as a school. Every day, the teachers and I are bombarded with questions from pupils which show a genuine curiosity to find out answers and learn something new. I witness creativity; not only in Art, Design Technology and Music but in every other subject as the children solve problems or design something from scratch. I see pupils’ characters growing as they make well-informed choices based on compassion; something which is serving to strengthen our inclusive and caring community. I watch as they never give up on their journey towards continuous excellence. But most of all, I smile because I am a part of that fantastic journey. I know that you will see all these character traits shining through as you turn the pages of this, our very first Muscat Cheltonian Magazine.

The physical beauty of the country alongside the warmth and friendliness of everyone I have met here will remain with me forever. I look forward to watching the school go from strength to strength over the coming years. Crispin Dawson Founding PrincipalThis year from the Founding Principal It has been an honour to bring Cheltenham education to Oman and to be the Founding Principal of this wonderful school. As I reflect on our founding year, I see the amazing progress that has been made, not only by the children, but also by the school as a whole as it has developed into the community it is today. Opening a new school is never easy, but the joy I have every day in seeing smiling children who are clearly enjoying the wonderful opportunities that they have, makes everything worthwhile. Memories that will live with me for some time are the community events, such as National Day celebrations, music concerts and the Art Exhibition, the sports tournaments, Odd Socks Day and the Jubilee street party.

Interested pupils were first asked to complete an application form. Those who demonstrated a commitment to school life and a positive attitude were invited to answer questions from three members of staff at a panel interview. They all handled this daunting task very well! We were most impressed by their thoughtful answers and calm composure. Nine pupils were appointed to the role and presented with their shiny Prefect badges and glossy ‘queue jump’ pass for the cafeteria. However, with some privilege comes a degree of responsibility! Our Prefects have been busy helping in various ways around the school in the library, on the sports fields, in Prep time with the younger children, at choir and as Reading Buddies with Grade 2, as well as playing an important supporting role at whole school events. We will be recruiting for Prefects again next year from Grade 8 and Grade 9. Keep an eye open for further details! Njud Rana Abdulrahman Mustafa Khadija Tala Rima Qais Ana Graciela Metacognitive Learning at Cheltenham By Mrs Haylie Saunders Some of you may know that I currently teach maths to Grade 5 pupils. My belief is that learning Mathematics involves a commitment to working hard and persevering when concepts are tricky. Not everybody finds Mathematics easy, but it is important to adopt a resilient attitude and I feel strongly that the grounding of most concepts lies firmly in the mastery of times tables. Times tables are linked to many concepts in maths and the pupils of Grade 5 find themselves using them for many areas of the curriculum. When I was young, my father used to test me on times tables questions before I could have supper. Whilst this method was highly effective for me (it combined my love of food with the necessity to get them right), I am not advocating this technique! However, I do support the importance of learning tables being reinforced at home and I remember my parents’ and teachers’ commitment to ensure I knew them. The mastery of this skill has stayed with me throughout my life and has never gone away, and for that I am extremely grateful. Thinking about how we think is something I have always found fascinating. However, metacognition is not simply ‘thinking about thinking’ , it is much more complex than this. Metacognition is actively monitoring one’s own learning and based on this monitoring, making changes to one’s own learning behaviours and strategies. Whilst greater independence is encouraged, all teachers here at Cheltenham Muscat have a huge part to play in this. For example, for pupils to become metacognitive, self-regulated learners, the teacher must demonstrate their approach to tasks and model effective strategies, drawing on any prior knowledge. This will be at the heart of the curriculum next year, as we look to drive the Building Learning Power DNA of Cheltenham College and enhance these skills within our pupils. Self-regulation will be key, as we will aim to foster a culture where pupils are aware of their strengths and weaknesses and can motivate themselves to engage in and improve their approach. The first year here at Cheltenham has seen a huge amount of progress both in the learning behaviours of the children after a period of remote learning, and the confidence that the pupils now have to ‘have a go’ at tasks that they would not have previously attempted. This has been particularly prevalent in our pupils who have English as an additional language, who have worked so hard to extend their vocabulary and reading this year. I have a saying that ‘Challenge should always be the norm’ in any classroom and all children should be stretching their brains in every lesson! However, as well as thinking hard, pupils need to think efficiently if they are to cheat the limitations"}

This has been particularly prevalent in our pupils who have English as an additional language, who have worked so hard to extend their vocabulary and reading this year. I have a saying that ‘Challenge should always be the norm’ in any classroom and all children should be stretching their brains in every lesson! However, as well as thinking hard, pupils need to think efficiently if they are to cheat the limitations of working memory; the work must be beyond pupils’ current capability but definitely within their reach. This is also an invaluable life lesson - a particular quote springs to mind: “ A man’s reach should always exceed his grasp.” Of course, the development of advanced problem-solving and decision making is a more complex process due to the slower developing region of the brain - the prefrontal cortex. This is an area that needs to continually be stretched for children. There are inevitably some aspects of the world that no amount of effort can prepare you for which is where breadth of opportunity is important for our future entrepreneurs, inventors and world-famous designers who I am sure are amongst our pupils here at Cheltenham Muscat. So, what are you waiting for? Encourage your sons and daughters to get out of their comfort zone, commit to and embrace a challenge with the best effort and preparation that they can and what follows next can only be personal satisfaction and success. THE MUSCAT CHELTONIAN | Founding Year 2021-226 7 THE MUSCAT CHELTONIAN | Founding Year 2021-22News from EYFS By Mrs Nicola Williams-Jones & Miss Becky Ashworth You could be tempted to underestimate the tiniest humans at Cheltenham Muscat. You might think that their first year at Cheltenham Muscat has been all fun and games – after all, they are only in KG, and you may think that deep learning happens exclusively for older children. But you could not be more wrong! Our youngest Cheltonians have approached this founding year (and for most, their first year at school) with courage, inquisitiveness and a desire to discover all about the world around them. From wondering about the plains of Africa to the fields of Wales, to measuring giraffes and building ghost towns, the learning in KG has been rich and full of surprises. As play is a crucial tool for early learning, our learners have underpinned their explorations with joy, friendship and excitement – and they certainly have been exploring! Let’s find out more about our year in EYFS by focusing on the five Cheltenham Cs … Curiosity Why aren’t there capital numbers? What makes an animal a reptile? How old is the tooth fairy? Why do we call them syllables? How do the seas stay wet? These are just some of the fascinating questions from our children which show how intrinsically curious children can be. Honouring a child’s curiosity and ensuring we ignite life-long learning were two fundamental considerations when we began our Curiosity Approach Accreditation. This is a two-year venture that will draw together some of the best Early Years practices from across the globe. It will ensure we underpin our environment and teaching with purposeful and authentic learning, so our pupils are continually questioning and thinking at a deep and meaningful level whilst becoming conscientious and independent individuals. Creativity An enormous part of KG is being creative – whether you are using loose parts to imagine a fairytale, finding natural materials to paint with, or problem-solving by considering a new perspective, the creativity never stops! This year we are creatively expanding and enhancing our state-of-the-art environment by bridging the gap between indoor and outdoor learning through the creation of a sensory garden. Phase 1 is now complete with a giant outdoor sandpit, which is not only aesthetically beautiful and reflective of the stunning Oman landscape, but also promotes courageous play so that the children can experience adventure, controlled risk and sensory stimulation.

Keep watching to see our garden grow and develop over the coming months. Continuous Excellence Our learners have shown tremendous resilience by joining school during the global pandemic. Continuous excellence in KG goes beyond the usual academics and includes growing as individuals by making new friends, being kind by learning sharing skills, being communicative by sharing our feelings and being proud of how far we have come. The seven EYFS Areas of Learning Nicola William-JonesStaff Jeanine Rosser Rebecca Ashworth Imogen Bance Hasna Al Balushi Intisar Al Hashmi Wafa Al Balushi Sumaiya Al Zadjaliand the ultimate Early Learning Goals have driven our academic successes. Collaboration and building Character From watching children imagine together, share together, think together, and learn together, there is no shortage of collaboration in EYFS. Our House system has created a sense of togetherness and the children are delighted to be red Kestrels, blue Ospreys, yellow Falcons or green Hawks. Wearing our colours with pride and learning co-operatively is a big part of who we are at Cheltenham Muscat. However, our school is only half of the team – the other part is you at home. Community There are so many adults involved in the education of a child, starting with their parents. We could not have asked for a better community to support the children through their first year at Cheltenham. The support from parents during online learning was phenomenal, from dressing up to making crafts and measuring shoes. It was lovely to finally be able to invite families in to play with their children during our Open Afternoon – the children were so proud to show their learning environment to their parents. Our school community has allowed us to share musical performances and sporting events which have been wonderful. To all the parents who supported the month of online learning, have read with your children, attended events and immersed yourselves in Cheltenham life – thank you! Thank you for partnering with us to ensure the best possible start to your child’s education and forming such a positive and energetic part of our school community. There is so much to share in EYFS and all of it is driven by our capable, ambitious tiny humans! Being a part of the founding year at Cheltenham Muscat has created many friendships and experiences that in themselves reflect our high standards and sense of community that is fundamental to the Cheltenham DNA. THE MUSCAT CHELTONIAN | Founding Year 2021-228 9 THE MUSCAT CHELTONIAN | Founding Year 2021-22Grade 1 By Ms Louise Oliff & Mrs Dagmara Simpson We started our founding year with much excitement and trepidation, not knowing how it would all unfold. We have had trials, tribulations and triumphs along the way, but most notable are the smiling faces of the pupils, who are happy in our school and have contributed to the creation of the Cheltenham Muscat family from the very first day. Reflecting on our inaugural year, it is testament to the willing little learners who have put their trust in what we do as teachers and travelled this journey with us. So how far have we come? Let’s see… In September, we opened our shiny, new doors to lots of children who were happy to be returning to school after almost two years of online education. They were excited and we were ready for them to start enjoying their education in person once more! In our first week, we invited our new parents to visit us and to see where their children would be spending their school days. Due to Covid, these visits have been few and far between, but we have made sure to stay in touch with updates and regular posts on Class Dojo"}

In our first week, we invited our new parents to visit us and to see where their children would be spending their school days. Due to Covid, these visits have been few and far between, but we have made sure to stay in touch with updates and regular posts on Class Dojo and other social media sites. It has been a joy to look back over all the Cheltenham Connected newsletters throughout this year. Some of the highlights for Grade 1 have been during our topic lessons, where we consciously link all our subjects together to help the children make connections within their learning. We had fun finding out about each other and ourselves during our All About Me topic. Knowing how to eat healthily and look after our bodies and minds have been essential to the children’s all round growth. They have also become more aware of their feelings and how to always act with kindness and compassion. Our adventures continued with our Ice Worlds topic, which saw us visit the polar regions and find out all about the landscapes and how plants and animals can survive there. The children learnt about melting and freezing and created their own mini-icebergs and solar ovens to see these scientific changes in real life! They also learnt about Captain Scott’s epic quest to reach the South Pole, which made us all think about whether we would be brave and hardy enough to challenge ourselves like this in future. There may well be an inspired, intrepid explorer among us!We rounded off our global travels with our final topic – Rainforest Adventure during which we found out about all the foods that grow there. Obviously, for many of us, the discovery of cocoa beans has been revolutionary! We all enjoyed some rainforest treats and used our mathematical skills in data handling to see which foods were most popular in a taste test. We also created toucans out of fraction circles which was a lovely way to combine some art and mathematics together. As well as the excellent academic progress we strive for, we are positively engaging our children with many opportunities to build on the social skills that they have not been able to practise during periods of lockdown. At the latter end of this academic year, we have been able to involve our families and welcome them back into the school to enjoy their children’s experiences with them. Many of our events are aimed at promoting a sense of global awareness and a feeling of community. The following photographs are a taste of some of the events and activities our pupils have been able to take part in.

THE MUSCAT CHELTONIAN | Founding Year 2021-2212 13 THE MUSCAT CHELTONIAN | Founding Year 2021-22Grade 2 By Mrs Lucy Visser It has been a fun and busy year in Grade 2, with lots of learning along the way. In Maths lessons, the pupils particularly enjoyed topics where they were able to engage with practical activities. They created nets for 3D shapes and used these shapes to build a paper town. It was fun to apply problem-solving and teamwork skills to a whole-class activity. Pupils also spent time doing a range of hands-on measurement activities from throwing beanbags and measuring the distance, timing how long it took for one another to complete an obstacle course and even some baking - yum! Grade 2 pupils have made great progress in their English lessons this year. They enjoyed channelling their inner-David Attenborough by researching and creating non-chronological reports about animals. When writing up their interesting facts, pupils made sure their non-chronological reports included headings, sub-headings, images and captions. In Science, pupils have been scientists- in-the-making building and investigating simple circuits using lightbulbs, motors and buzzers. They have also enjoyed learning about light and dark, how shadows are formed, how the sun can be used to pop a balloon and finding out whether objects really do bend when placed in water! Highlights from Topic lessons have included learning about a range of different artists and pupils trying their hand at recreating some famous works of art. Pupils also loved building, painting and erupting their own volcanoes as part of our Extreme Earth area of learning. Lucy Visser Nichola Gibson Shatha Al Saadi Ikhlas Al-RawahiStaff THE MUSCAT CHELTONIAN | Founding Year 2021-2214 15 THE MUSCAT CHELTONIAN | Founding Year 2021-22Grade 3 By Mrs Umber Janjua and Mrs Ann Lawlor In Grade 3, we are incredibly proud of our founding pupils who have worked tirelessly throughout a year of many changes to form strong friendships and achieve academic excellence. One of our most notable and impactful topics this year has been Reduce, Reuse, Recycle where pupils explored the effects of human activity on the world we live in today and the impact it can have on their tomorrow. Embodying 21st century global citizenship, Grade 3 explored the school building and devised strategies to improve the ways in which we can reduce, reuse and recycle in and around the school. Pupils wrote persuasive letters to our Executive Principal, Ms. Claire Adby, expressing their feelings, thoughts and suggestions to improve the school’s carbon footprint. They were thrilled to have a formal meeting with the school’s Architect (Mr Fisher), Operations Manager (Mr Visser) and Ms. Adby herself to discuss their suggestions and pave the way for a greener Cheltenham Muscat! We believe that educational experiences like these will provide pupils with the confidence and conviction to truly become global citizens by looking forward to and finding solutions for the problems we encounter whilst achieving academic success.

Pupils enjoy utilising the calming facilities and expanding array of books during English lessons and in their spare time. Our literary passion was also highlighted through our “Book with A View” and “Extreme Reading” competitions. It has been exciting to kickstart collaborations between Cheltenham Muscat and Cheltenham College. Pupils have enjoyed writing to and receiving letters from their fellow Cheltonians, reading all about the differences between Oman and the UK. As well as sending letters to their pen-pals, Cheltenham Muscat pupils thoughtfully crafted poems to send to the UK. As part of our ECA (Extra Curricular Activities) programme, we also established a founding Newspaper Club. It seemed only fitting that our Editor- Emily QuinlanStaffin-chief contributed his own thoughts to the first edition of the Cheltonian Magazine. Read what Meer, our Editor-in- chief, has to say here: The founding year for Cheltenham Muscat was one filled with memorable moments and events. From Omani National Day to House Sports Day, this year was one to stay with our students for an exceptionally long time. This year was a perfect example of perseverance in our students as they really stepped up through struggles and hardships. It is also a particularly important year academically for our Grade 8 students as they chose their IGSE subjects. This year was packed full of excitement, curiosity, and marvel. – Meer, Grade 8. Cheltenham Muscat pupils have also thrived academically in English. They have enhanced their reading comprehension skills and their language analysis. They have written creatively and analytically, producing excellent newspaper articles, advertisements, letters, diary entries, stories, plays, descriptions, comparative essays, reviews, reports, poems… to name but a few! They have also refined their speaking and listening skills through drama and presenting in the classroom, library and outdoors. We look forward to what the next academic year brings, and we look forward to our English department growing. THE MUSCAT CHELTONIAN | Founding Year 2021-2218 19 THE MUSCAT CHELTONIAN | Founding Year 2021-22Arabic By Dr Q I can hardly believe that the first school year at Cheltenham Muscat has passed so quickly. The pupils in my Arabic lessons are, more often than not, at the forefront of my mind. They pass through my memory one by one until their names, smiles, grades, way of holding a pen, and their defiant and persistent attempts to imitate an exemplary reading of poetry, stories, or other pieces of literature are intertwined. Together we have come a long way on our journey. The pupils’ reading is improving daily, and their grammatical, spelling and rhetorical knowledge is developing rapidly. The mother of one of our Grade 6 pupils was not the only one who came to give me good news. Her eyes shone with happiness that her son had begun to syntactically analyse every sentence he came across. He continuously asks for examples from her and his father to prove how proficient he has become in the basics of Arabic grammar. How happy I was to hear that! Perhaps the most remarkable stop during this year’s journey was the school’s launch of the I Read Arabic platform, which has provided pupils with access to a variety of Arabic books according to their reading levels. I have been delighted by the pupils’ excitement every Thursday to find out who will be Reader of the Week. I have also discovered that pupils are not limited to just reading and listening to books but can also solve tasks related to the curriculum"}

However, the journey is still long, and the need to encourage pupils towards reading in Arabic has only just begun. Dr Mohammed Al QutaitiStaffThe school’s celebration of World Book Day was another opportunity full of joy and inspiration to introduce pupils to Arabic books and books from around the world, translated into Arabic. It was a unique opportunity to learn who the Arabic readers are among the pupils, find out more about what they like to read and come together to read part of an Arabic novel. World Book Day was an excellent opportunity to encourage pupils to access the wonderful collection of Arabic books that the Cheltenham Muscat Library has, those on the I Read Arabic platform or those they can buy from the upcoming Muscat Book Fair. Finally, I am looking forward to seeing the pupils next academic year. Their features seem a little different. They have grown up over the year, and the challenge and determination to achieve more have grown with them. THE MUSCAT CHELTONIAN | Founding Year 2021-2220 21 THE MUSCAT CHELTONIAN | Founding Year 2021-22 Arabic B By Miss Suaad Al Zaabi and Mrs Heba Hamed An integral part of living in an Arab country is learning and understanding the Arabic language. Whether native speakers or not, pupils at Cheltenham Muscat are fortunate enough to study and learn about the Arabic Language during their time at school thanks to our Arabic B curriculum. This year, we have learnt many things in Arabic, starting with basics such as saying hello and introducing oneself to learning about the weather, seasons, clothes, and so much more. Pupils have also learnt about numbers, shapes, colors, the calendar, fruits and vegetables, body parts and the Arabic alphabet, with its complicated short and long sounds and how to write them in a word. We are extremely proud of the accomplishments that our Arabic B pupils have made, as some of them are now able to understand what is being said in an Arabic conversation, not to mention their ability to read and write in Arabic. Absolutely tremendous work Arabic B pupils!

From the outset, we have linked the curriculum in each grade to the local and global environment. This has enabled pupils to realise many environmental problems, propose appropriate solutions to them, and express their opinions and points of view regarding the way they live their lives. This was particularly evident in practical sessions in which the pupils worked to represent their theoretical knowledge through drawings, graphs and models that helped them to revise and demonstrate their understanding of what they had learnt. The Social Studies course teaches and promotes the values of good citizenship, including the rights and duties of a citizen, and the characteristics that he should display. This is achieved by emphasizing the need to display the values of honesty, trust, cooperation, respect for regulations and laws, and a sense of individual and collective responsibility. A variety of activities within the classroom builds generations who are keen to contribute to the development of society. In addition, holistic teaching methods lend themselves to empowering leadership, self-reliance, problem solving, public speaking and debating.

THE MUSCAT CHELTONIAN | Founding Year 2021-2224 25 THE MUSCAT CHELTONIAN | Founding Year 2021-22Islamic Studies By Mrs Huda Al Derbashi History of Islam Islam is the second largest religion in the world after Christianity, with about 1.8 billion Muslims worldwide. Although its roots go back further, scholars typically date the creation of Islam to the 7th century, making it the youngest of the major world religions. Islam started in Mecca, in modern-day Saudi Arabia, during the time of the prophet Muhammad’s life. Today, the faith is spreading rapidly throughout the world. What is Islam? Islam means to achieve peace – peace with God, peace within oneself, and peace with the creations of God – through wholly submitting oneself to God and accepting His guidance. The term Islam derives from the three-letter Arabic root, S ( س -)L (ل -) M (م ,)which generates words with interrelated meanings, including “surrender” , “submission” , “commitment” and “peace” . Commonly, Islam refers to the monotheistic religion revealed to Muhammad ibn (son of ) Abdullah between 610 and 632 of the Common Era. The five pillars in Islam 1. Profession of Faith (shahada) 2. Prayer (Salat) 3. Alms (Zakat) 4. Fasting (Sawm) 5. Pilgrimage (Hajj) (for those who can physically, mentally or financially) What do we teach in Islamic Studies? In Islamic Studies we teach our pupils about the beautiful morals of Islam, and we teach them more about their religion and culture. We encourage them to Huda Al Derbashi Staffstrengthen their relationship with Allah which helps them to become the best version of themselves. Morality in Islam Moralities in Islam include kindness (to people and animals), charity, forgiveness, honesty, patience, justice, respecting parents and elders, keeping promises, and controlling one’s anger. Islam also commands love -love of God and those God loves, love of his messenger (Muhammad) and of believers.

Others have been reintroduced to French after a pause in their language learning during the pandemic. Pupils have made good progress in these languages but, perhaps more importantly, they have enjoyed sharing information about their own native languages and cultures. Pupils have studied the Francophone and Spanish speaking worlds through film, poetry, song, and country case studies and have been inspired by cross curricular lessons and polyglots from around the world. A brave few have added a fourth modern language to their weekly workload by joining the German ECA which will hopefully expand to include more year groups next year. The department looks forward to offering French and Spanish to pupils from Grade 3 upwards next year and seeing the first cohort of pupils begin their IGCSE language studies.

The entire school got involved in our Times Table Rock Stars event representing Cheltenham Muscat which placed us 77th out of over 300 schools across the world! We also had Pi Day competitions where pupils memorised Pi to over 50 decimal places in a competition; a test of memory and of course a fun prize! For World Mathematics Day we also participated in a Matheletics competition, in which pupils did amazingly well, with some pupils coming first in the country for their age group. We hope to keep building on the results year after year! Cheltenham Muscat mathematicians have grown in confidence and character and have regained their love of learning mathematics being back in school. Pupils have enjoyed being able to use mathematical equipment such as meter rulers, tape measures, measuring cylinders, stop watches and trundle wheels in practical situations. Group activities and outdoor learning have made mathematics come to life. As a STEM school, we ensure there are lots of cross-curricular themes in Mathematics with other subjects such as; Geography, Science, Technology, Digital Literacy and Art. As a school we celebrated STEM week and pupils enjoyed seeing how mathematics forms a part of STEM. We have had lots of opportunities to link mathematics and Art together, starting with origami in lessons which lead to origami being offered as an extra-curricular activity Sean WilliamsStaffensuring Maths and Art come to life together to create unique 3D objects and animals. Mathematics Photos with art ECA club photos (origami frogs, whole class photo, individual photos) All pupils have flourished in mathematics with their knowledge and skills deepening, their interests and creativity explored, as well as learning mathematics as a community. We ensure that learning mathematics is real and applicable to life situations from learning to count in Grade 1 to navigation using trigonometry and bearings in Grade 8. All pupils have developed fluency, reasoning and problem-solving skills. As well as learning about mathematicians throughout history, they have been able to think like mathematicians and work like a mathematician, spotting patterns in Mathematics and finding links between different topics and ideas. We are excited to see what next year brings; more pupils, more staff and more mathematics! THE MUSCAT CHELTONIAN | Founding Year 2021-2230 31 THE MUSCAT CHELTONIAN | Founding Year 2021-22 Science and STEM By Mr David Nguyen The founding year at Cheltenham Muscat has been an eventful one for the Science Department. Having state of the art science laboratories has allowed pupils from Grades 4 to 8 to experience hands- on scientific experiments while learning biology, chemistry and physics. This allowed pupils to develop their science enquiry through creative, practical activities where teamwork was essential. All pupils have had the opportunity to safely use Bunsen burners for a range of experiments such as checking the boiling point of water, flame tests and the combustion of metals. Pupils also had the opportunity to use scientific equipment to accurately measure volumes of liquids and to use balances to find the mass of solids before reacting chemicals to create new products. In Physics, some pupils learned about sound and how instruments work, building circuits, investigating forces such as friction and air resistance, as well as using ray boxes to study reflections and refractions, to name but a few. In Biology, pupils learned about the impact of humans on other organisms, using microscopes to investigate cells. They also made models to learn about the different types of cells and enjoyed finding out how much energy is present in food."}

We held our first STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) week where pupils were challenged to complete activities throughout the week, requiring them to apply all of their STEM skills. In science, pupils had to identify unknown metals based on the colour of the flame they produced in a Bunsen burner. Our STEM club has seen our pupils carry out many experiments including balloon rockets, density columns, investigating the number of stomate on the bottom of leaves, building electronic wire mazes, and many more! In science, pupils have been able to see the cross-curricular links between Science, Geography, Mathematics, English, Computing, Music and Art & Design Technology. The importance of presenting data in tables and graphs, our impact on organisms and the world, as well as how we are using technology to make new discoveries is evident in pupils’ learning at Cheltenham Muscat. As the saying goes, ‘It takes a village to raise a child’ , and this could not be more in science. The aforementioned activities would not have been possible without the support of Mr Williams, Ms Narkiewicz, Ms Claire and, of course, our amazing science technician, Ms Al Shuali. We could not be prouder of what our pupils have been able to achieve both in practical, scientific investigations and also in their understanding and application of theory to the real world. We cannot wait to see how much more they will develop over the coming years. David NguyenStaff THE MUSCAT CHELTONIAN | Founding Year 2021-2232 33 THE MUSCAT CHELTONIAN | Founding Year 2021-22Global Perspectives By Mr Richard Widdop The subject that was initially launched as Global Perspectives back in September included elements of geographical studies and British historical topics within its curriculum content. However, the true definition of Global Perspectives is that it is a subject which focuses on learning styles, using global issues as points of research, which are then subsequently delivered in a project style format. Having taken over the teaching of Global Perspectives in January, it was decided that the pupils would benefit most by focusing on more global issues in their learning, using more traditional geographical topics, whilst still retaining the ‘Global Perspectives’ element of the subject. In the lower school pupils enjoyed learning some basic geographical location and mapping skills that would later facilitate their learning about world biomes, world oceans, environmental threats, and world country development. The pupils in Grade 4 put together two wonderful displays about plastics in the ocean and how Oman might implement a better recycling policy in the future. The level of development in each country was displayed using flags and a range of indicators were presented to compare many countries and their various stages of development. Pupils concluded that they felt extremely fortunate to live in Oman where life is very favourable! Pupils were particularly challenged when they were asked to present some data using a Scatter graph. There were some very respectable outcomes for this challenge – well done! In Grade 6 pupils were taught about the mountain environment, the rainforests of the world, population issues and latterly some more detailed mapping skills involving scale, direction, grid referencing, and some actual Ordnance Survey work akin to the UK mapping system. Pupils enjoyed producing country comparisons of the demographics of various countries during their work on population and were extremely interested in real-time data about population change over time. There was some lively discussion about comparing richer and poorer countries of the world and the future of their demographic change.

There was some lively discussion about comparing richer and poorer countries of the world and the future of their demographic change. The higher grades in the school also studied aspects of world demography as part of their topic in Term 2 together with world weather and climates. The pupils were challenged to produce their own climate graphs and research some climate extremes, such as hurricanes and tornadoes. The global issue of climate change was also covered and debated. It was interesting to learn the perspectives pupils had previously held about this most important and dominant topic. This part of the curriculum caught the imagination of many pupils, particularly those that had not witnessed the variety of climates that span our planet. Term 3 saw the pupils look at world urbanization and the impacts this is having on major cities of the world. A closer study of the Dharavi informal settlement in Mumbai, India, brought a particular sense of empathy about the differing living standards around the world and the influence of charities in their work in these most desperate of places. It has been a very enjoyable experience teaching a range of global issues at Cheltenham Muscat over the past two terms. The pupils have responded positively to the topics that have been introduced to them and these will hopefully act as a firm foundation for their future study of the subject.

Pupils have been working enthusiastically hard to create a wide variety of projects which were celebrated in our first ever Art and Design exhibition this June. This included monstrous felt hand puppets, ceramic potted planters, issue-based portraits, collages, prints, observational studies, CAM toys, 3D printed key rings and laser-cut maze games. Architecture was another key theme throughout the exhibition. Grades 6, 7 and 8 began by celebrating Architecture from Oman in a series of Art pieces and then went on to explore Ellie WilsonStaffconcepts for sustainable architecture for Oman’s future in design technology, finally modelling their ideas in AutoCAD. Pupils from Grades 4 to 8 were also able to enjoy a series of trips to the amazing Alia Al Farsi gallery. Alia al Farsi is one of the most celebrated and internationally recognised Omani Artists and her work has inspired many of the pupils in their personal projects. We were lucky enough to welcome her to Cheltenham Muscat as the guest of honour to open our exhibition. Pupils were able to show her the work they had created and explain the ideas behind their paintings. We couldn’t be prouder of the work that the pupils have created, often eagerly using their break times to make sure their work is finished for display, showing that hard work conquers all!

In December, when we were unable to invite visitors to the school because of Covid restrictions, an informal concert in the atrium brought the school community together. The Senior Choir, which rehearses every day, Clare DawsonStaffwas established early on in the year, and gave its first formal performance at the school’s opening ceremony in March. In June, we gave two concerts to parents as part of our Music and Art Open Afternoon; all of the children from KG to Grade 5 sang, and there were performances from many of the older children too. In May, the Senior Choir visited the Royal Opera House Muscat to take part in a singing workshop with the Munich Boys’ Choir. This was a huge privilege. In the same month, Grade 4 visited the brand new exhibition (called Oman and The World), also at The Royal Opera House. Then, on 30th May, all pupils from Grades 5-8 were fortunate enough to attend a concert given by the Muscat Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, which had been put on especially for Cheltenham Muscat. What an honour! All in all, and despite the many challenges, it has been an excellent year for Music at Cheltenham Muscat. We look forward to more lessons, concerts and trips next year.

We were lucky enough in Term 1 to get our hands on some Cricket World Cup tickets at the national stadium in Al Amerat. 30 pupils from Grade 6 attended the opening game of the World Cup, played between Oman and Papa New Guinea. It was a very hot day, but it was great to see some live sport at last, after many limitations due to Covid. For some of our pupils, cricket was very much a new proposal, but the format of Twenty20 means it is exciting to watch and they enjoyed it hugely. We ran our first ever school cross country event during the first term, which was a lovely opportunity to see our pupils compete against one another. Thank you to Miss Innes for all her hard work, enthusiasm and inspiration. The pupils competed over a course distance of 750m and 1.5km depending on year group. Hopefully, next year the course can be altered to utilise the fantastic typography we have at our disposal. We also had our first ever house football competition, which was hotly contested and won by the Kestrels. Sports Day for all grades was a huge success and, most importantly, enjoyed by all those who took part. I particularly liked the standing long jump from our KG pupils, who only managed to cover about two inches of ground but made for a very sweet activity to watch! It was fantastic to see the Grades 5 to 8 come together and compete in their school houses. We had a make-shift running track which hosted the relays, sprints and hurdle events. There were some excellent performances across the board, especially Mrs Saunders nose-dive in the wheelbarrow race! Miss Innes set up a brilliant middle-distance run which was well attended. Well done to all those who competed. Congratulations again to the winning house, the blue Hawks.

As well as the basics of many of the sports the pupils have looked at, aspects such as rules, tactics and game management have also been high on the agenda. In Badminton for example, the variety of shots, importance of the serve and how to play doubles have also been taught. As well as Badminton, the pupils have also looked at Volleyball, Gymnastics, Ballet, Tennis, Cricket, Hockey, Rounders, Dance, Invasion Games, Rugby, Football, Dodge Ball, Athletics and Swimming.

To be able to host the first sports fixture for Muscat schools in two years was brilliant and it was amazing to see the spectators’ gallery full and buzzing with noise. Three out of the four Cheltenham participating teams finished in the top three which was a fantastic achievement. Playing sport for my school was always crucial for me growing up. It was where I met many of my closest friends. The social opportunities these tournaments generate are invaluable, especially after all the online learning throughout the pandemic. It was wonderful to see the children interacting with one another within the different teams. Thank you to Muscat Pirates and The American British Academy (ABA) for attending the tournaments. Fin BerryStaffCheltenham Football Tournament By Coach Berry (Mr Blueberry) Our final inter-school sports tournament of the 2021/22 academic year welcomed Grades 7 & 8 with an indoor football tournament. Three Cheltenham teams battled it out against two teams from British School Muscat (BSM) in a round- robin format leading to a bronze and a gold final. The Cheltenham A team finished on top of the group with two wins & two draws and went on to play BSM Team A in the gold final. The final was full of excitement with some good shots early on including a near-perfect header from Denzell Harvey which just clipped the outside post. After the allocated time had run out, and neither team had scored, we moved on to a penalty shootout. British School Muscat Team A had a chance to win but were denied by an excellent save from Qais Al Harthi. BSM eventually went on to win the shootout 4-3. All the boys who participated in the football should be immensely proud of the effort and support they showed for one another.

Our Resident Book Worm! By Miss Jalala Al Shamsi As part of the Cheltenham Muscat philosophy, moulding curious pupils who are eager to explore has occurred in the library throughout the founding year. Our library has had an integral role in the academic process to fulfil the intellectual needs of the pupils, as well as the professional development of the teachers. The recourse circulation has grown continuously, and the hosted reading sessions and clubs have been remarkably effective throughout the year. The library has a range of different sections.More than 30 pupils can use the library at the same time. Starting from the most lovable area for storytellers and quiet readers, going through the makerspace and group working area, and the surrounding fiction and non- fiction bookshelves, and ending with a meeting room for discussions and individual study. Unlike traditional libraries, the Cheltenham Muscat library has collaborated with the academic departments to support pupils’ reading progress at school through a variety of books and at home through the e-library. The school community has participated in worldwide activities such as World Book Day. Pupils have engaged well with Jalala Al ShamsiStaffthe library and have all been able to find, borrow and read texts to suit their interests. Pupils have shown their awareness of the importance of reading to discover the world through creative works. Library books have been essential to inspire our pupils to live in different worlds of fantasy, science fiction, classics and more. They have the passion not just to read but also to recommend the books they love to other readers in their book reviews. “A Book with A View” was an amazing chance to share recommendations of books as well as holiday locations!

Producers: The stars Author: William Shakespeare Director: Mr. Drama Duration:1h 5min Rating: Last week, the children performed a play for the rest of the school. They were performing Romeo and Juliet written by Shakespeare. Overall, the performance was a catastrophe! This was due to many reasons. Firstly, the play started 15 minutes late! Even though everything was set up, they were finalizing the script. I understand that it is necessary as the children do not know all the complicated words but at least they could have done it beforehand. It was as if they were making the play from scratch. For some of the time there was someone trying to entertain the crowd, but trust me, they were not good at it. Secondly, they didn’t know half the script. I could not have known what was happening if I hadn’t known the play from the start. I thought that it was confusing. Overall, I think that the play was absolutely a disaster, and I am glad I was not paying for it.

By Mr Julian Snell (father of Benji Snell and Grandfather of Archie and Willa Snell) 1971 - 76 Being dropped off at Leconfield by my parents, on an early September afternoon and welcomed by Housemaster Guy Wilkin was a rather daunting experience. I knew no one, not having been at the Junior School, nor a feeder prep school. All 3rd formers went into a dormitory on the top floor and had a desk for prep work downstairs. Shacks were only for the 6th form. The whole scale of College was mind boggling and I am sure I spent many hours of the first few weeks just trying to find where I was meant to be. Not being very sporty, I spent many a wet afternoon trogging back and forth to Lower Reeves, where the Yearlings Cs ran about in the mud being fairly useless! I opted for rowing in the spring and summer term, which over the course of my College life, I thoroughly enjoyed. As I didn’t start to grow until I was in the Lower Sixth, I was selected as the 1st Eight cox when in the 4th and 5th form and we had great fun at Regattas around the country, led by Malcolm Mennie and David George (DBG). DBG also ran the CCF, which I joined in preference to Wednesday afternoon ‘community service’ . Images of Wednesday afternoons and him swearing at the old three- ton Army lorry, which he often tried to start with a crank handle, will be with me forever! The classroom wasn’t my favourite place – in my defence, I genuinely believe the teaching was poor compared to today’s standards and facilities. There was the odd highlight during my five years, but overall, I found the five years underwhelming. I was beaten more than once, so I probably wasn’t the perfect pupil. I was made a House prefect for my last term. But I have no hard feelings. I have not suffered any ill-effects that I know of and have led a happy and successful life since leaving. Public (well ... private) schools in the early ‘70s in England were at a low ebb and Cheltenham College, led by David Ashcroft, was possibly no exception. As a small example, after my O-Levels, I had to choose 3 A-Levels to study and, unbelievably, was encouraged to do two subjects (Biology"}

As a small example, after my O-Levels, I had to choose 3 A-Levels to study and, unbelievably, was encouraged to do two subjects (Biology and Politics & Economics) which I had not done at O-Level! Unsurprisingly, I only just passed them, but did well enough to apply to join the Army and attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst a few months after leaving College. 1997 - 2010 I have often been asked why Sally and I selected College for our four boys after my experiences there. Well, we could easily see that the school had improved dramatically in the 25 intervening years and we are delighted that we did. We believe in and support the Benji first day at Cheltenham College UK. boarding ethos. Our eldest son, Benji, joined in September 1997, with a sports scholarship (possibly a contributing factor!), joining Leconfield of course, and his three brothers (Olly, Joey and Hugo) joined at regular intervals thereafter (two of them with sports scholarships too). It is probably fair to say that they all enjoyed the sports pitches more than the classroom, but they were well taught and, most importantly, loved the whole College experience. It helped that they started at College with many friends from Beaudesert School, or in Hugo’s case, from the Junior. I need to put on record here that I am eternally grateful to Denis Smith, the Bursar, for his understanding when I was made redundant in 2002. Until 2008, all the boys benefited from Karl Cook as their housemaster and he managed the boys in such a good way that they not only loved College life, represented the College 1st teams in most sports, but also made life-long friendships and have remained in close contact with Karl since they left (he was even at Benji and Zoe’s wedding in 2012!) 2021- Present Benji applied for and was appointed as the first OC in the Common Room of Cheltenham Muscat, as Lead Tutor and Head of Sport, starting in August 2021. His wife, Zoe, also joined the non-academic staff as Head of Communications. What a fantastic opportunity for them, with two young children, to be in at the start of a brand- new school, in an amazing country (I say that from experience, as I worked in the Middle East, including Oman, for 13 years) and with such important and close links to his old school as well. Archie (6) and Willa (3) are now Cheltonians, which makes me very proud. I sincerely hope Cheltenham Muscat is a huge success as it grows over the coming years to be the pre-eminent British School in Muscat and that Benji and his family thrive there. Olly (Army Apache pilot); Joey (Tennis coach and becoming a Rackets professional at Harrow) and Hugo (senior sales role at Scott Dunn) are all very happy, doing well in their chosen fields of expertise and have, without doubt, benefited from the five years they spent at College. So, the money, which I eventually paid in full, was well spent!

It is always a special moment when I go back and visit Cheltenham College as it is a place that holds so many amazing memories for me. I am particularly looking forward to going to the Cheltenham Cricket Festival this summer, an event which is held on College Field and hosts teams from the County Championship, as well as international exhibition matches. I am excited to see what the future holds for the Cheltonian Society here in Muscat as I am sure we will all get to attend some equally brilliant events.

It was a privilege to join you for the official opening, when we were able to meet staff, pupils and parents. Thank you for your hospitality and we look forward to a range of collaborations in the coming year. It has been a busy and eventful year here in the UK. As pandemic restrictions lifted, we had the chance to reflect on all the exciting opportunities presented to our pupils and parents. We have seen our pupils continue to gain excellent examination results.. Our A-level grades over the last 5 years have been consistently over 80% A*-B and GCSEs have been over 70% from grades 7-9. I have every confidence that this year’s hard working Upper 6 and Fifth form, will once again excel when those all-important August 2022 results are announced. We are very much looking forward to working alongside the teaching staff in Muscat to support the first group of pupils as they move through into their GCSE courses. At Cheltenham College we have also developed our curriculum in new and exciting ways, with four new qualifications in the 6th form (Years 12 and 13) in the last two years. The Cambridge Technical courses in Business and ICT will see their first results this year and two new courses in Psychology and Sport begin in September. The extension courses in Year 9 are now fully embedded; Computing , Leadership, Public Speaking and Presentation skills as well as the Foundation Project Qualification. We have also set out on a new and exciting technological journey, with our new Head of Digital Learning leading the way with a variety of new initiatives and a move towards consistency of device and provision in the coming year. We were awarded the National Cyber Security Centre’s CyberFirst status at Bronze level in September 2021 and we hope to achieve Gold standard in the year to come. Technical developments will make working alongside Cheltenham Muscat even easier as time moves on. University offers this year, despite a challenging landscape post Covid, have been excellent and we have seen a larger than usual number of pupils applying to American, Canadian and other overseas universities. The success rate for scholarships has been higher than ever and there will be some terrific collaborations to support US and UK university"}

The success rate for scholarships has been higher than ever and there will be some terrific collaborations to support US and UK university entry for Cheltonians of Muscat as the school expands into A-Levels. In the creative arts, this year has seen an array of music concerts and events including a performance of Rachmaninoff’s 2nd piano concerto by one of our leading Year 12 musicians, accompanied by probably the best orchestra we have ever had in recent years. Our senior choir performed the highly complex Mass in B Minor by Bach and our Jazz band played in the prime slot at the Cheltenham Jazz Festival. Another highlight was the Year 3-Year 9 pupils all contributing to a joint school event in the Cheltenham Town Hall where 400 children sang to an audience of over 1,000. We were very impressed by the highly talented musicians we met performing at the Cheltenham, Muscat opening ceremony in February this year. At the end of January, our Prep School staged a highly creative production of ‘The Lion King; whilst we celebrated excellence in Drama at the Senior School with the staging of the complex Sondheim musical ‘Into the Woods’ at the Cheltenham Playhouse. This was followed by a talented cast production of Jane Austin’s ‘Pride and Prejudice’ .. We look forward to the Year 9 and 10 production of Golding’s ‘Lord of the Flies’ later this term too. One of the joys of a return to a normal school routine has been the ability to implement a full programme of sport for all pupils at the College. So far, this academic year we have had pupils being actively engaged in 19 different sports. 166 teams have represented the College in 1,033 fixtures and sporting events; figures that highlight the breadth of sporting opportunity on offer to pupils of all ages and ability levels. We hope very much to arrange a variety of visits for pupils in the years to come, both from and to Muscat, and sport will no doubt feature in some of the exciting plans. All in all, this has been a very positive return to school life here in the UK, but the most exciting aspect of our year has been the collaboration with you, Cheltenham, Muscat. We look forward to working closely together in the years to come.

You will have specialist subject tutors for every subject you study. At College we will encourage you to take responsibility for your own learning but we will also support you with a strong pastoral framework. Throughout your time at College we will provide advice both on revision and relaxation and there is always someone to talk to, whether it’s the Sixth Form mentors, your tutor, your Housemaster or Housemistress, one of the Matrons, other teachers, College’s Counsellors or the Chaplain.

In 2023 our pupils placed at 49 different UK institutions including, Oxford, Cambridge, Bath, Bristol, Cardiff, Durham, Edinburgh, Exeter, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle, Warwick and York to name some. All candidates for Oxford and Cambridge met their offers and 69% of our pupils are heading to Russell Group universities. Top subjects to be studied include Business Management, History, Politics, Engineering, Healthcare and Economics. Cheltenham College Head, Nicola Huggett remarked: “In this most challenging year, with a return to full content for all A Level subjects, we are absolutely delighted to see the hard work of our wonderful Upper Sixth Form pupils rewarded. They have worked extremely hard and both they and the amazing staff at Cheltenham College should be deservedly proud of all that they have achieved together. This has been a great team effort on all fronts. We are so pleased that we have continued to see this upward trajectory in our academic outcomes. These results have been many years in the making for our pupils and the depth of their character shines through, not just in these achievements, but also in their many other contributions to our wider community. As a year group, these young people have really led by example in their commitment to charity and partnership work, to sport, music and drama too. We thank them for the legacy they leave behind them and we know they will go on to great things in their future careers.” A Level Highlights from 2024 0 of pupils’ results have been graded A*-B 0 of pupils gained A* and A grades A Level Results A* A*-A A*-B 2024 11% 41% 75% 2023 20% 52% 79% 2022 20% 54% 81% 2021* 45% 75% 91% 2017-2021 22% 55% 80% * COVID year, featuring TAGS and CAGS Oxbridge Preparation Oxbridge Preparation Higher Education & Careers Higher Education & Careers Sixth Form Overview Sixth Form The Prep The College Vacancies Prospectus Aims & Policies Public Benefit Term Dates Privacy & Terms Modern"}

In the Third Form, when pupils are 13 and 14, the curriculum includes a wide range of subjects, including two modern languages, three sciences and Latin. It also includes Computing lessons, leadership and public speaking modules, and all pupils complete the Foundation Project Qualification (FPQ). The Fourth and Fifth Forms see pupils studying for GCSEs and IGCSEs. These are important public examinations that lay the foundations for A Level and also play an important role in university admissions and job applications. Most pupils take ten GCSEs and IGCSEs, including English Language, English Literature, Maths, at least two sciences and one modern foreign language. These core subjects are complemented by a further four option subjects. Discover more about the curriculum in Fourth and Fifth Form (Years 10 and 11), by downloading the Fourth and Fifth Form Curriculum Guide 2024-26. In Sixth Form – or Upper College – pupils specialise, studying a smaller number of subjects at greater depth. The majority take three A Levels and all complete the Extended Project Qualification (EPQ). Some pupils take CTech or BTEC instead of A Level for subjects where it is available as an alternative, and a small number take on four A Levels. Discover more about A Level subjects at College here. We actively encourage diversity in subject choice and promote the logical mixing of arts, sciences, humanities and languages. Unlike other schools, we do not prescribe blocks of subjects, but try as far as possible to accommodate each individual’s choices. We also believe in inspiring pupils to be curious and explore subjects in more depth. Our Academic Extension activities are an integral part of College life and include extension classes, Lower and Upper College Society, evening subject society meetings, debating, trips and visits. The programme not only embeds a love of learning that will last a lifetime but also supports Higher Education applications. Top results in Maths, English, Sciences, Geography and History.

As pastoral practitioners, we pride ourselves on knowing every child as an individual, ‘every boarder’s journey will be different’ is often a line used when speaking to prospective parents. Our boarding staff look at how the boarding environment needs to be tailored and personalised to each individual, whilst still building our extended family. The sense of community within Cheltenham is incredibly important and is what makes our pupils, from Third Form to Upper Sixth, thrive as boarders. Pastoral Care At the heart of our Pastoral Care is each pupil’s Tutor and Housemaster or Housemistress (HsM). Pupils have an individual reflection meeting every two weeks, discussing academic progress and overall development as well as how they are feeling within themselves. Twice a year, all Third Form pupils take an online assessment with Steer Tracking (a pastoral assessment and tracking tool). This enables College to track each pupil’s social-emotional development, so we can proactively give our pupils the right support at the right time, in the right way. Anti-Bullying Our Anti-Bullying, Behaviour and Rewards and Sanctions policies promote the importance of ensuring that pupils feel supported to prevent bullying. In 2023, all pupils committed to ‘Saying they are in’ and ‘Calling it out’ when they witness unkind or bullying behaviour, with each pupil signing a pledge to be part of this effort. When reporting on the College in 2023, the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) found that “[Pupils] are courteous and sensitive to the feelings of others and have a healthy respect for their peers and teachers.” Relaxation and Social Life We recognise that our pupils need well-deserved down-time to relax and decompress after their busy days. Across the Houses, each House offers a safe space for pupils to catch up on their work and spend quality time together. Whilst we embrace the educational benefits that technology brings us, we also are aware that our pupils need time away from their screens and socialise together. There is a huge array of social experiences on offer and House activities range from cooking nights to trips out to theme parks. Social events are popular at College, from quiz nights to dinners and informal dances. Time for reflection and mindfulness is given each day in Chapel, and our Third Form pupils have the option to take part in Meditation and Mindfulness.

During that time around 250 pupils have been trained to listen to their peers and offer them support. Peer Mentors are between 13 and 18 years of age and each one chooses to become a Peer Mentor. The training lasts ten weeks and is delivered during lunchtime by staff trained in these areas. Pupils meet for between 30 and 45 minutes each week and receive training on: Self-awareness Understanding body language Listening with your heart, head and gut The difference between empathy and sympathy Adopting a non-judgmental approach Understanding the theory of the 5 Love Languages Navigating a conversation Confidentiality and privacy Case studies and peer review At the end of the course, each pupil is interviewed by the trainer to check their understanding. Following this the Peer Mentor signs a written agreement and is awarded a Peer Mentor badge. Experienced Peer Mentors can also work towards a Peer Mentor tie. This is awarded to those who have taken the initiative to lead small groups in their own Houses, helping with homesickness, relationships, self-awareness, or social activities to encourage friendship between new groups of pupils. The Peer Mentor keeps a close relationship with their trainer, and knows that they can ask them for advice or help at anytime.

For breakfast, the Danish pastry selection is very popular! Our match teas are enjoyed by parents and visitors alike, who consistently express their enjoyment of our homemade cakes. Each meal is freshly prepared from scratch using fresh ingredients from a network of regional suppliers. There is a dedicated nutritionist who guides pupils and staff towards a balanced plate, advocating for the inclusion of wholegrain carbohydrates, lean proteins, fibrous vegetables and even desserts – emphasizing that every nutrient has its place in a healthy balanced diet. There are also engaging foodie events like ‘Meet the Supplier’ days and ‘Eat the Seasons’ tasting tables, encouraging exploration, and understanding of nutritional values. We prioritise sustainability by actively managing food wastage, displaying real-time data on digital screens to showcase the impact of individual choices. Our commitment to a more sustainable future extends to an enticing selection of vegan options prominently featured at the counter. Innovative culinary experiences include the introduction of ‘Scrumble,’ a crumble dessert station, empowering pupils to customise their dessert with lower sugar content while maintaining flavour. ‘Sensational Seeds,’ our serve-yourself seed bar, introduces pupils to the nutritional wonders of six popular seeds, accompanied by informative posters and flyers tailored to different age groups.

Applications are open to all Lower Sixth pupils, and awards are made following an interview process with a panel of three CET trustees. This Summer, Isa had the opportunity to travel to France and has shared her experience below. “This summer, I found myself constantly battling unending heat, relentless mosquitoes and my inability to navigate French public transport. Despite this, I loved every second of my two weeks spent in Montpellier, France (more so after working out which of the four tramlines would actually take me in the right direction)! When I first decided to apply for a Travel Award, I knew I wanted to do something that would support my French A Level, and thanks to some helpful recommendations, I decided to sign up for a French program that provided local hosts, daily lessons, and a busy activity timetable. Every morning I had three hours of French lessons and each afternoon I would spend with my friends exploring the town’s restaurants, beaches and monuments. Although it was initially a challenge to navigate the 30 minute walk to school and get used to living with my host and her two cats, I’m so glad I applied for the award, as it has boosted my confidence in speaking French and given me friends I hope to keep for life as well as dreams of working in France after Uni.” – Isa The Prep The College Vacancies Prospectus Aims & Policies Public Benefit Term Dates Privacy & Terms Modern Slavery Statement Sitemap © 2025 Cheltenham College.

Their visit was part of the G-PIE 2025 Conference (Global Perspectives on International Education), a prestigious international event that brought together pupils from around the world. During the conference, pupils engaged in a wide range of thought-provoking discussions, collaborative workshops, and cultural exchanges focused on global citizenship, sustainability, and the future of education. The experience not only broadened their academic horizons but also offered a rich immersion into Indian culture and the diverse perspectives of fellow pupils from across the globe. “I was very fortunate to travel to India with the school last term to attend the G-PIE conference. It was a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of cultures I hadn’t previously encountered. My favourite part of the conference was hearing presentations from pupils representing different schools, where they shared unique aspects of their educational experiences. This allowed me to compare their perspectives with my own and broaden my appreciation for the many ways of learning and living across the globe.”- Written by Mills “I feel incredibly lucky to have visited India in June, as it gave me the chance to explore India’s rich cultural diversity and connect with people from around the world. This experience helped me to immerse myself into new perspectives and to step outside of my comfort zone. The thing I enjoyed most was that this trip changed how I see global communities and my place within them.”- Written by Emma “Our host schools, Doon and Welham, did an excellent job attending to us. The conference itself focused on developing our intercultural competency through the exploration of Indian culture and the wider cultural world. The weeklong project on the importance of water conservation brought us all together, aiding in the formation of friendships which still last to this day. The interview process to attend the conference greatly helped to reinforce our communication skills, which were required routinely throughout. G-PIE offered a judgement-free space where all thoughts and ideas were heard and recognised. We were also given the opportunity to immerse ourselves in Indian culture, which welcomed us to question our preconceived expectations. Our walk through the wonderful neighbourhood of Dehradun exposed us to individuals who approach life from a different angle. Their commitment to their religious beliefs and practices was beautiful to witness. We were kindly given the opportunity to celebrate the sacred Ganges alongside them, allowing us to go “below the iceberg” of Indian culture. This conference might just be the key you’re looking for to begin your journey of self-development and discovery.” – Written by Saskia “The G-PIE conference we attended was a novel and interesting experience that I"}

The conference itself was held in India this year and a wonderful opportunity to engage with and explore Indian culture while also focusing on the key themes of the conference; Culture (Particularly focusing upon Cultural Communication), Water and AI. While exploring such subjects we also got the terrific opportunity to go “below the surface” of Indian culture by being able to visit, explore and engage with Indian practices and holy sites. The most memorable experience was witnessing the religious practices occur on the banks of the Ganga (Ganges) as it began to rain following a sweltering few days. I also enjoyed the experience of meeting a new and diverse range of people from countries such as Bhutan and Rwanda, making new friends with whom I am still in contact today.”- Written by Cameron The Prep The College Vacancies Prospectus Aims & Policies Public Benefit Term Dates Privacy & Terms Modern Slavery Statement Sitemap © 2025 Cheltenham College.

Nicola Huggett, The Head of Cheltenham College said; “All at Cheltenham College are absolutely delighted with these fantastic results. Our Upper Sixth pupils have worked incredibly hard and these grades, which are the best we have seen in a number of years, are a fitting tribute to their drive and commitment, alongside that of the hard-working staff at the College who have supported them. We are delighted to see, this morning, that a terrific 83% of pupils are in to their first choice university, and 96% have been offered places in either their firm or insurance choice , which again, is a record for us. I am so proud of this Upper Sixth year group who have been a joy to teach and to know, and undoubtedly they will now go on to even greater heights beyond the College.” Many of the Sixth Form leavers are now looking forward to their next steps following their Cheltenham College education, with the highest ever figure of pupils achieving places at their first choice universities. This year, university destinations include; Durham, Edinburgh, Exeter, University College London, London School of Economics and Imperial College London to name a few. Five pupils will be continuing their studies at the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. Looking to explore international higher education options, 30 pupils applied to universities overseas, and 10 pupils have offers to universities in the USA, eight to universities in Canada, seven to universities in Europe and five to universities in China and Australia. Collectively, the pupils have received 19 scholarship offers from overseas universities.

Abridged College rules - Clothing, Jewellery, Make-up and Hair These rules are not exhaustive but are an abridged version of the most important rules and commonly asked questions related to uniform and appearance, so that parents are familiar with the expectations of pupils at College. Hair Hair should always be trim and neat. It should not cover the eyes or, in the case of boys, extend on to the collar. Closely shaven head, (#2 or lower), mullets, or undercut hair are not permitted and could lead to a gating or suspension for a period of time. Boys’ hair should be the same length at the back and sides and graded. For both boys and girls, hair should be of a natural colour and roots should be the same colour as the rest of the hair. If a pupil’s hair is inappropriate they may be House gated, be issued a chit, and expected to remedy it at the first opportunity. Pupils should not cut their own or other pupils’ hair. Eyebrows must not be partially or fully shaved. Jewellery and Make -up Girls may wear one pair of small earrings which must only be worn in the lower lobe of each ear, one chain, which must not be visible, around the neck, one plain ring (not oversized) and one bracelet (not beaded). No jewellery is to be worn during games. Body piercing, apart from the lower ear lobe, is not allowed. Girls may wear subtle make up. Boys may wear one chain, which must not be visible and a bracelet (non beaded) and a stud earring. Body piercing is not allowed for boys. One charity band may be worn in place of a bracelet. Staff may confiscate jewellery or clothing that contravenes these guidelines and place it in College Office. Clothing and Appearance All members of College are expected to be tidily dressed at all times. Members of College should be in College uniform or, if involved in games, College games kit, until their activity is finished. Casual clothes should always be clean, in good repair and appropriate to the occasion when they are worn, once pupils’ College commitments have been honoured. For Sunday Chapel, a College tie, white shirts and black shoes are to be worn by boys and girls. Suits are also allowed. The following footwear is not allowed – suede shoes, moccasins, brown kickers, boots or shoes with coloured stitched soles.

For PE and Games, they require the full crested track - suit as demonstrated below with crested sweat pants and the crested hoodie. They will then require the crested navy t-shirt, crested shorts, white socks, and trainers. All Pre-Prep pupils should also have a crested hat for the Summer Term (either the crested bucket hat or crested junior cap; available from Surridge) and should have the navy crested rucksack for transporting their sports kit. For Swimming, pupils need swimming goggles, a towel and navy, plain swimming jammers (boys), navy, plain one-piece swimsuit (girls) and the navy crested swim bag. Year 2 Pupils require the same swimming kit as the rest of Pre-Prep, as well as the same PE kit mentioned on the adjacent page. However, instead of the crested navy sweat pants, pupils should have the crested poplin track pants. Year 2 pupils will also start to take part in our major games and therefore require certain other items.

All pupils wear their tracksuit over the top of their games and PE kit and should have this with them every time they have sport. Also shown below is the crested school games bag which is required in Years 5, 6, 7 and 8. We highly recommend that you have your childs’ initials branded on the bag by Surridge for easy identification in the boot of a coach. For Years 3 and 4, the children use the crested rucksack and crested swim bag. Please do not purchase the crested school games bag until children enter Year 5. PE Kit For PE, all pupils should wear the navy crested t-shirt available through Surridge. Pupils can either wear their crested navy skort or shorts. Autumn Term Girls - Hockey Boys - Rugby Spring Term Girls - Netball Boys - Hockey Summer Term In the Summer Term, the main sport is Cricket and both girls and boys will wear their whites, but only for matches. Cricket match kit pictured below. Due to repeatedly washing white clothes, we encourage pupils to wear their Autumn/Spring kit, or PE kit, for Games lessons, saving the whites for match day. For boys playing hardball Cricket, they require a pair of box pants to keep their box in place and, although the school do provide spares, having your own box is more hygienic. These items are not available from Surridge at present, but can be found at most sports shops, or through Amazon. For Tennis, the girls should wear their pink games top, navy skort and white socks (same as Netball). For those Rowing, they can wear their PE kit, but must have a pair of trainers that they don’t mind getting wet and a towel."}

Abridged College rules - Clothing, Jewellery, Make-up and Hair These rules are not exhaustive but are an abridged version of the most important rules and commonly asked questions related to uniform and appearance, so that parents are familiar with the expectations of pupils at College. Hair Hair should always be trim and neat. It should not cover the eyes or, in the case of boys, extend on to the collar. Closely shaven head, (#2 or lower), mullets, or undercut hair are not permitted and could lead to a gating or suspension for a period of time. Boys’ hair should be the same length at the back and sides and graded. For both boys and girls, hair should be of a natural colour and roots should be the sam e colour as the rest of the hair. If a pupil’s hair is inappropriate they may be House gated, be issued a chit, and expected to remedy it at the first opportunity. Pupils should not cut their own or other pupils’ hair. Eyebrows must not be partially or fully shaved. Jewellery and Make -up Girls may wear one pair of small earrings which must only be worn in the lower lobe of each ear, one chain, which must not be visible, around the neck, one plain ring (not oversized) and one bracelet (not beaded). No jewellery is to be worn during games. Body piercing, apart from the lower ear lobe, is not allowed. Girls may wear subtle make up. Boys may wear one chain, which must not be visible and a bracelet (non beaded) and a stud earring. Body piercing is not allowed for boys. One charity band may be worn in place of a bracelet. Staff may confiscate jewellery or clothing that contravenes these guidelines and place it in College Office. Clothing and Appearance All members of College are expected to be tidily dressed at all times. Members of College should be in College uniform or, if involved in games, College games kit, until their activity is finished. Casual clothes should always be clean, in good repair and appropriate to the occasion when they are worn, once pupils’ College commitments have been honoured.

It has been a long time since the sports kit was reviewed as a whole. In recent years kit, fabrics and colours have become incredibly varied. Parents have been required to respond on a piecemeal and ad hoc basis to new items of sports kit being issued, without being able to plan effectively. Therefore, from September 2022, all College and Prep sports kit will be updated to ensure consistency of appearance and performance, as well as to standardise as many items as possible across both schools. In the first year only one item, the match day tops for boys and girls, will be compulsory. We would prefer that all pupils were wearing the rest of the new kit from September 2023 onwards. Please click each of the boxes below to find about the key changes that are to come. Our new sports kit Our new sports kit has been updated to standardise items and ensure consistency of appearance across both The Prep and College. View the updated kit Our visual identity We have introduced an updated logo at the same time as the sports kit review. Please click below to preview the updated school identity. View the updated identity Key details about the changes What is changing? From 3 September 2022, the College and Prep sports kit and logo will be updated. Why is this change taking place? We regularly review our sports kit and uniform to ensure that it meets the needs of pupils, parents, staff and the school. We aim to ensure that the kit supplied is fit for purpose, provides value for money and presents the school in the best possible light. The changes for September are a part of this process. We have delayed any planned updates of the visual identity of the school to September 2022 to fit as best as possible with these reviews and ensure as little disruption as possible. There is more information about this below. When will they come into effect? The updated sports kit can be used from the beginning of September 2022. We recognise the environmental and cost implications of introducing new sports kit. As such, it will not be mandatory to wear the new sports kit during the 2022-23 academic year. We would prefer that for the 2023-24 academic year, all pupils are wearing the updated kit. The only exception will be for match day sports tops, where teams will be required to have matching, updated tops. Pupils can continue to use current shorts, skorts and socks should they wish to. Selected first teams will continue to have numbered kit supplied by College, in line with current practice. When can we purchase the new sports kit? The updated sports kit will be available to"}

The updated sports kit will be available to purchase from Surridge Sports from 1 June 2022. Where can we purchase the new sports kit from? The updated sports kit will be available to purchase from Surridge Sports from 1 June 2022. An updated link will be provided as soon as it is available. Will the new sports kit cost more? We have worked hard throughout the process of developing the sports kit to standardise items where possible. Rugby, Netball and Hockey playing tops have been standardised and shorts, skorts, tracksuits, jackets and accessories have been standardised too, allowing them to be used across both schools. The Bursar will buy back shirts that have only been used during the 2022/23 year that are in good condition. These shirts will be used to increase the supply of second hand kit available in future years. Can my child continue to wear the current sports kit? For sport, other than matchday playing tops, all current kit can be used throughout the 2022-23 academic year. Selected first teams will continue to have numbered kit supplied by College, in line with current practice. The Rugby 1st XV will retain its red and black striped kit, which has historic significance and is recognised nationally. We would prefer that for the 2023-24 academic year, all pupils are wearing the updated kit. Which items are being standardised between The Prep and College? Rugby, Netball and Hockey playing tops have been standardised and shorts, skorts, tracksuits, jackets and accessories have been standardised too, allowing them to be used across both schools. Do I have to purchase all items and accessories for my child? The uniform list for 2022 onwards will indicate the items that are required and the items that are optional for each section of the school. This document will be published in the coming months. My child partakes in sports that are not covered by the core sports kit offering – is there updated kit available for these sports? Some sports require College-branded kit from specialist suppliers. Any updated kit that is purchased from these suppliers can be used from September 2022 onwards. Equestrian, Polo, Rowing and Shooting kit is likely to be supplied by alternative suppliers and this will be confirmed in the coming months. Parents will be issued with information as soon as it is available. What is happening to all of the old sports kit? We have arrangements with several charities and organisations that would like to re-use and recycle any old College and Prep kit. The Barefoot Project, Gogar School in Kenya and Shamrock School in Nepal are all a part of this project. More information on the collection and distribution of old kit will be available nearer to September 2023.

It takes ownership of ‘Cheltenham’ as a destination for educational excellence. Cerise, Black (at College) and Blue (at The Prep) have all played an important part in the history of our schools. The use of Cerise and a Midnight Blue is a nod to the history of both schools and a fitting combination of each school’s colours that reflects our close relationship. The word College uses a serif font. Serif fonts are often used to reflect tradition or value. This font combines with the school crest to ensure that our heritage is noted within this updated logo. The use of a modern sans serif font for the word Cheltenham demonstrates the vibrant, curious and forward-thinking community that we are a part of. We are proud to have world class festivals, speakers and culture on our doorstep. A focus on the word Cheltenham highlights our place at the centre of a town famed for its educational excellence. It is also an echo of the calls heard from supporters across our sports pitches each week: ‘Come on Cheltenham!’ Understanding our new logo A refined, modern solution"}

Now more than ever as we transition out of the pandemic, we must be responsive and reactive to each individual situation. We are open six days a week (excluding Sunday) between 8.00am and 6.00pm, and are trained to manage illness and injuries that may occur to pupils, staff, or visitors as well as to respond to emergency situations. This includes training in the use of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs), of which there are seven across College premises. The team offer a wide range of services from managing acute medical problems to supporting pupils to manage their own chronic health conditions such as asthma, epilepsy, diabetes and allergies. We pride ourselves on also offering a safe space for pupils who want to drop in for support or a friendly chat. Communication is key to supporting your child, so please ensure that your child’s Health Certificate is completed with as much detail as possible. This should include details of any chronic conditions, any past or existing mental health concerns and details of treatments that have been, or are in place. Our team is involved in both PHSE and the Floreat Programme, providing health promotion and education to pupils. This direct approach helps to establish better links with both House groups and individual pupils. The health and pastoral care teams work together to make sure that pupils are offered excellent health and wellbeing support where necessary, and appropriate referral to other services as required. During the Rugby and Hockey seasons we employ external, qualified First Aiders, to provide pitch side support. Local Hospitals Cheltenham General Hospital (NHS) is extremely convenient and is our main local referral source, although for some procedures admission may be arranged at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. There is a good local private hospital, the Nuffield Cheltenham Hospital to which most private referrals are made. There are times when it would be more appropriate to use hospitals (NHS or private) nearer a patient’s home, for example towards the end of term, and this is something that can quite easily be arranged. We ask that you attend to routine eye examinations and dental services during the holidays, although this can of course be arranged locally if required.

Dr Jim Ropner, Chief Medical Officer, oversees clinical practice and is a Council Member of the Medical Officers of Schools Association (MOSA), who meet regularly to develop and review best practise in the school setting. He has been involved in writing National Guidelines for the Management of Concussion in schools. Dr Georgia Woodburn works alternate days so that pupils have the option of seeing either a female or male GP. Surgery is every week day morning 8.00am to 9.30am with clinics on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. GPs are available for nursing staff to discuss any concerns throughout the day. All boarding pupils are automatically registered with a College GP so that we can ensure we have a comprehensive overview of their health needs. It is on strong recommendation from the Department of Health and MOSA that pupils at boarding schools are registered at the school. Due to the amount of time they spend at College, seeing a GP at home can be challenging and it is also crucial that we are able to access their medical records to be able to support them if they are unwell when at school. If your child is undergoing any kind of treatment or support from external services, either physical or emotional, please share this information with the Health Centre to enable us to coordinate with the appropriate teams at: nurses@cheltenhamcollege.org Referrals to other specialists can generally be made on the NHS where needed, but unfortunately this is often not as prompt as we would like. Many parents choose to have private cover and the school offers a scheme through the Bursar’s office if this is required. You will be informed if your child is referred to a specialist. This may be done by the GP, nurses, or Matron who will also accompany pupils to any appointments and take notes. This information is then fed back to the Health Centre team. Please do contact us if you would like to discuss anything in greater detail. The team of seven nurses are managed by Lead Nurse Fiona Parry and supported by two administrators. With backgrounds in the NHS, as well as school and overseas nursing, they have a wealth of experience. Each Boarding House has a named Link Nurse who liaises with Matrons, monitors medicine usage, and delivers teaching sessions in House. Nurses monitor childhood immunisations for the boarders and will contact you regarding any that are recommended for your child. We ask that your child be immunised according to the UK immunisation schedule so that we may protect the wider College community. For current recommendations, please visit the UK Government website.

Topics covered include good hygiene, healthy eating, vaping, cancer awareness, pregnancy choices, consent and relationships. College takes a proactive approach to sexual health, and tries to empower pupils to make positive choices with our support. We are part of Gloucestershire’s participation in the national C-Card Scheme. Details can be found on their website: https://eddystone.org.uk/blogs/c-card-sites-gloucestershire Parents are invited to contact the Health Centre at any time to discuss any aspects of the scheme or College’s sexual education policy. The Nurses also engage in First Aid training for staff and some pupils when the curriculum allows. This may include basic life support, sun safety, what to do in the event of an asthma attack or an epileptic fit. We are keen to develop this further and value the importance of instilling practical skills in pupils that may serve them, or indeed others, well in the future. The Chadwick Programme at The Prep has a First Aid strand to it, and has given pupils confidence in helping with emergency situations.

Please contact us for current prices when required. There is a particularly large uptake of travel vaccines administered to Upper Sixth pupils in preparation for gap year travel. We can advise on recommended vaccines and provide travel health advice for all pupils. Kindly contact us a minimum of 8-12 weeks prior to travel so that we have time to vaccinate. Some of the vaccines require more than one dose. Each vaccination will require a separate signed consent form which we can email to you upon request. For last minute travel it is always worth asking regarding the recommendations and we will do our best to vaccinate as far as possible. Holiday Treatment If your child should need treatment during the holidays, this may be arranged with your family doctor as a ‘temporary resident’. If your child has any operation, accident, severe illness or is given vaccinations, please notify the Matron on return to school and inform the Health Centre, preferably in writing. This is especially important to ensure that vaccinations are not duplicated, and to ensure that any medication is safely administered as intended. If your child returns to school with medication, please hand this to the Matron, who will dispense appropriately. We ask that all medication is signed in with Matron, in certain cases Self Medication Forms can be signed and the pupil can keep their own supply of medication. This needs to be authorised via the Health Centre. This is to protect both your child and others.

This is a getting to know you exercise. We get to know any medical problems or concerns that pupils may have and they become familiar with the Health Centre and staff. It serves as an opportunity for us to tell them about the services we offer and how we can help. If your child has underlying health conditions we will arrange for a new pupil medical, which may include: A brief medical examination – We pay particular attention to factors which are important to education, which may not have been examined in the past, particularly eye sight and hearing. Height, weight and body mass index (BMI) are measured, to get a baseline and thereafter done termly in House. This allows us to monitor any emerging trends. You will be contacted by the Lead Nurse in the first instance if we have any concerns regarding either a high or low BMI. On-Site Physiotherapy Services Stuart and Sarah Fossella offer a comprehensive Musculoskeletal Physiotherapy service helping students to get back to sport and a pain free life as soon as is possible. They typically treat muscular and joint based injuries in pupils from The Prep through to Sixth Form students, in a well-equipped room within The Health Centre. They have over 10 years experience as qualified Physiotherapists (Bsc Hons) and have a background in private practice. Before this they both worked overseas and for the NHS. When they are not in clinic at College, they work at their own practice in Cheltenham. For any queries please contact: physios@cheltenhamcollege.org They work closely with the entire Health Centre team, rehab team, coaches and Matrons to keep everyone informed about injury progress and anticipated return to sport.

Any child over the age of 16 is able to give consent for their own treatment. Any child under the age of 16, if thought to be mature enough, is also able to give consent. The duty of confidentiality owed to a person under 16 is as great as that owed to any other person. We do however seek parental consent for College staff to administer prescribed and non-prescribed medicines and to give boarders immunisations as recommended by the Department of Health. The consent form is found on the back page of the Health Certificate. Please be aware that in the absence of your consent we would not be legally permitted to administer medications. The Head, Health Centre Staff and Matrons can act in loco-parentis and will, in incredibly rare situations, consent for emergency treatment, operations etc. We will always endeavour to contact parents or guardians and gain consent verbally in such a situation. Confidentiality Most medical matters within the school do not need strict confidentiality, for example a child with a sore throat or sprained ankle would approach Matron. Matron will send the child to the Health Centre where treatment plans are made as appropriate. Most pupils are happy for this information to be relayed to House staff. For the vast majority of cases, it is in the pupil’s best interest that Matron, teachers and sports staff know what is happening and there are no difficulties regarding confidentiality. From a medical point of view there are very few instances when we would not strongly encourage a pupil to discuss all aspects of their medical care with their parents and this is something we would always encourage pupils to do. However, every patient’s expectation of confidentiality must be respected and the law on confidentiality and consent is very clear.

They know that their Housemaster or Housemistress, Matron, and Tutor are there to be able to talk things through with them and this is often the first point of call. However, sometimes the pupil might want a more neutral place to think things through and this is where they can get help from the Student Support Service based in comfortable surroundings in the Health Centre. This service is provided by Rachel Melville-Thomas and Stuart Hannah who are both Specialist Child and Adolescent Psychotherapists. They trained within the NHS and are members of the Association of Child Psychotherapists. They both have many years of relevant mental health experience. A student can ask for an appointment directly or may be referred by a member of staff, with their agreement. They can be offered up to eight sessions of individual counselling. If it is felt that the young person or child requires further support, this is available from the same therapist at a reduced rate paid to College. This service is particularly valuable at the moment, as trying to access mental health support for adolescents is currently difficult via the NHS or privately. In the Prep, the same service is called Pupil Support and is always accessed via either staff or parent referral. In this case, the therapists will always speak to parents first, ideally in a meeting or by telephone to discuss concerns and clarify the process of help, including feedback to parents. Working with younger children may involve, play, drawing, and story making. If you would like to contact them directly please email in the first instance at: r.melville-thomas@cheltenhamcollege.org or s.hannah@cheltenhamcollege.org In addition to counselling, Rachel Melville-Thomas can also offer mindfulness sessions within a small group setting. This practise helps us have a greater understanding of ourselves, and can help with the management of stress and anxiety. These are particularly useful during the run up to exam time. Should you feel your child needs increased support on any given day, please contact the nurses on 01242 265 629 who will endeavour to help and provide support.

Pupils are well cared for in House with many minor illnesses. However, if they have diarrhoea and vomiting our expectation is that they are removed from College as soon as possible after they develop symptoms. This may mean that guardians have to collect pupils and care for them until well enough to return. Therefore, please ensure that guardians are aware of this and live within a reasonable radius of College. The unwell pupil will need to stay away from College until they have been clear of all symptoms for 48 hours. This is in accordance with Public Health England Recommendations and is aimed at preventing outbreaks of infectious diseases that can greatly affect a boarding community. Communication If two-way communication between home and school works well everything runs more smoothly. The obvious link in this chain is the pupil, but on occasions this is not as reliable as we would like and Matron should also be kept informed of changes to your child’s health.

Our service was established to provide high quality, evidence-based healthcare with the aim of promoting lifelong physical and emotional well- being. We take the responsibility of looking after your child very seriously, and recognise that it can be worrying if your child is unwell when they are away from home. Now more than ever as we transition out of the pandemic, we must be responsive and reactive to each individual situation. We are open six days a week (excluding Sunday) between 8.00am and 6.00pm, and are trained to manage illness and injuries that may occur to pupils, staff, or visitors as well as to respond to emergency situations. This includes training in the use of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs), of which there are seven across College premises. The team offer a wide range of services from managing acute medical problems to supporting pupils to manage their own chronic health conditions such as asthma, epilepsy, diabetes and allergies. We pride ourselves on also offering a safe space for pupils who want to drop in for support or a friendly chat. Communication is key to supporting your child, so please ensure that your child’s Health Certificate is completed with as much detail as possible. This should include details of any chronic conditions, any past or existing mental health concerns and details of treatments that have been, or are in place. Our team is involved in both PHSE and the Floreat Programme, providing health promotion and education to pupils. This direct approach helps to establish better links with both House groups and individual pupils. The health and pastoral care teams work together to make sure that pupils are offered excellent health and wellbeing support where necessary, and appropriate referral to other services as required. During the Rugby and Hockey seasons we employ external, qualified First Aiders, to provide pitch side support. The Team & Services The Health Centre works in partnership with Berkeley Place Surgery in Cheltenham. Dr Jim Ropner, Chief Medical Officer, oversees clinical practice and is a Council Member of the Medical Officers of Schools Association (MOSA), who meet regularly to develop and review best practise in the school setting. He has been involved in writing National Guidelines for the Management of Concussion in schools. Dr Georgia Woodburn works alternate days so that pupils have the option of seeing either a female or male GP . Surgery is every week day morning 8.00am to 9.30am with clinics on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. GPs are available for nursing staff to discuss any concerns throughout the day. All boarding pupils are automatically registered with a College GP so that we can ensure we have a comprehensive overview of their health needs. It is on strong recommendation from the Department of Health and MOSA that pupils at boarding schools are registered at the school. Due to the amount of time they spend at College, seeing a GP at home can be challenging and it is also crucial that we are able to access their medical records to be able to support them if they are unwell when at school. If your child is undergoing any kind of treatment or support from external services, either physical or emotional, please share this information with the Health Centre to enable us to coordinate with the appropriate teams at: nurses@cheltenhamcollege.org Referrals to other specialists can generally be made on the NHS where needed, but unfortunately this is often not as prompt as we would like. Many parents choose to have private cover and the school offers a scheme through the Bursar’s office if this is required. You will be informed if your child is referred to a specialist. This may be done by the GP , nurses, or Matron who will also accompany pupils to any appointments and take notes. This information is then fed back to the Health Centre team. Please do contact us if you would like to discuss anything in greater detail. The team of seven nurses are managed by Lead Nurse Fiona Parry and supported by two administrators."}

With backgrounds in the NHS, as well as school and overseas nursing, they have a Dr Jim Ropner, Chief Medical Officer Lead Nurse Fiona Parry wealth of experience. Each Boarding House has a named Link Nurse who liaises with Matrons, monitors medicine usage, and delivers teaching sessions in House. Nurses monitor childhood immunisations for the boarders and will contact you regarding any that are recommended for your child. We ask that your child be immunised according to the UK immunisation schedule so that we may protect the wider College community. For current recommendations, please visit the UK Government website. Travel Vaccinations We offer a comprehensive travel vaccine service to pupils who are registered with us, most of which incur a fee just as they would in a GP surgery, which is then added on to your school bill. Please contact us for current prices when required. There is a particularly large uptake of travel vaccines administered to Upper Sixth pupils in preparation for gap year travel. We can advise on recommended vaccines and provide travel health advice for all pupils. Kindly contact us a minimum of 8-12 weeks prior to travel so that we have time to vaccinate. Some of the vaccines require more than one dose. Each vaccination will require a separate signed consent form which we can email to you upon request. For last minute travel it is always worth asking regarding the recommendations and we will do our best to vaccinate as far as possible. Health Promotion Our health promotion services cover a range of topics and age appropriate material, across both Cheltenham Prep and College. Topics covered include good hygiene, healthy eating, vaping, cancer awareness, pregnancy choices, consent and relationships. College takes a proactive approach to sexual health, and tries to empower pupils to make positive choices with our support. We are part of Gloucestershire’s participation in the national C -Card Scheme. Details can be found on their website: https:// eddystone.org.uk/blogs/the-eddystone-trust/ c-card Parents are invited to contact the Health Centre at any time to discuss any aspects of the scheme or College’s sexual education policy. The Nurses also engage in First Aid training for staff and some pupils when the curriculum allows. This may include basic life support, sun safety, what to do in the event of an asthma attack or an epileptic fit. We are keen to develop this further and value the importance of instilling practical skills in pupils that may serve them, or indeed others, well in the future. The Chadwick Programme at The Prep has a First Aid strand to it, and has given pupils confidence in helping with emergency situations. Medicals Your child will have the opportunity to visit The Health Centre within their first week at College. This is a getting to know you exercise. We get to know any medical problems or concerns that pupils may have and they become familiar with the Health Centre and staff. It serves as an opportunity for us to tell them about the services we offer and how we can help. If your child has underlying health conditions we will arrange for a new pupil medical, which may include:A brief medical examination : We pay particular attention to factors which are important to education, which may not have been examined in the past, particularly eye sight and hearing. Height, weight and body mass index (BMI) are measured, to get a baseline and thereafter done termly in House. This allows us to monitor any emerging trends.

Height, weight and body mass index (BMI) are measured, to get a baseline and thereafter done termly in House. This allows us to monitor any emerging trends. You will be contacted by the Lead Nurse in the first instance if we have any concerns regarding either a high or low BMI. Consent The law on this is quite straightforward from a medical point of view. Any child over the age of 16 is able to give consent for their own treatment. Any child under the age of 16, if thought to be mature enough, is also able to give consent. The duty of confidentiality owed to a person under 16 is as great as that owed to any other person. We do however seek parental consent for College staff to administer prescribed and non-prescribed medicines and to give boarders immunisations as recommended by the Department of Health. The consent form is found on the back page of the Health Certificate. Please be aware that in the absence of your consent we would not be legally permitted to administer medications. The Head, Health Centre Staff and Matrons can act in loco-parentis and will, in incredibly rare situations, consent for emergency treatment, operations etc. We will always endeavour to contact parents or guardians and gain consent verbally in such a situation. Confidentiality Most medical matters within the school do not need strict confidentiality, for example a child with a sore throat or sprained ankle would approach Matron. Matron will send the child to the Health Centre where treatment plans are made as appropriate. Most pupils are happy for this information to be relayed to House staff. For the vast majority of cases, it is in the pupil’s best interest that Matron, teachers and sports staff know what is happening and there are no difficulties regarding confidentiality. From a medical point of view there are very few instances when we would not strongly encourage a pupil to discuss all aspects of their medical care with their parents and this is something we would always encourage pupils to do. However, every patient’s expectation of confidentiality must be respected and the law on confidentiality and consent is very clear. On-Site Physiotherapy Services Stuart and Sarah Fossella offer a comprehensive Musculoskeletal Physiotherapy service helping students to get back to sport and a pain free life as soon as is possible. They typically treat muscular and joint based injuries in pupils from The Prep through to Sixth Form students, in a well-equipped room within The Health Centre. They have over 10 years experience as qualified Physiotherapists (Bsc Hons) and have a background in private practice. Before this they both worked overseas and for the NHS. When they are not in clinic at College, they work at their own practice in Cheltenham. For any queries please contact: physios@cheltenhamcollege.org They work closely with the entire Health Centre team, rehab team, coaches and Matrons to keep everyone informed about injury progress and anticipated return to sport. Local Hospitals Cheltenham General Hospital (NHS) is extremely convenient and is our main local referral source, although for some procedures admission may be arranged at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. There is a good local private hospital, the Nuffield Cheltenham Hospital to which most private referrals are made. There are times when it would be more appropriate to use hospitals (NHS or private) nearer a patient’s home, for example towards the end of term, and this is something that can quite easily be arranged. We ask that you attend to routine eye examinations and dental services during the holidays, although this can of course be arranged locally if required. Student Support Services It is entirely normal during the course of school life for a young person to have concerns that are troubling them.

Student Support Services It is entirely normal during the course of school life for a young person to have concerns that are troubling them. They know that their Housemaster or Housemistress, Matron, and Tutor are there to be able to talk things through with them and this is often the first point of call. However, sometimes the pupil might want a more neutral place to think things through and this is where they can get help from the Student Support Service based in comfortable surroundings in the Health Centre. This service is provided by Rachel Melville- Thomas and Stuart Hannah who are both Specialist Child and Adolescent Psychotherapists. They trained within the NHS and are members of the Association of Child Psychotherapists. They both have many years of relevant mental health experience. A student can ask for an appointment directly or may be referred by a member of staff, with their agreement. They can be offered up to eight sessions of individual counselling. If it is felt that the young person or child requires further support, this is available from the same therapist at a reduced rate paid to College. This service is particularly valuable at the moment, as trying to access mental health support for adolescents is currently difficult via the NHS or privately. In the Prep, the same service is called Pupil Support and is always accessed via either staff or parent referral. In this case, the therapists will always speak to parents first, ideally in a meeting or by telephone to discuss concerns and clarify the process of help, including feedback to parents. Working with younger children may involve, play, drawing, and story making. If you would like to contact them directly please email in the first instance at: r.melville-thomas@ cheltenhamcollege.org or s.hannah@ cheltenhamcollege.org In addition to counselling, Rachel Melville-Thomas can also offer mindfulness sessions within a small group setting. This practise helps us have a greater understanding of ourselves, and can help with the management of stress and anxiety. These are particularly useful during the run up to exam time. Should you feel your child needs increased support on any given day, please contact the nurses on 01242 265 629 who will endeavour to help and provide support. Unwell Pupils We have three beds, including an isolation room, where pupils can rest and be monitored whilst waiting for collection or a treatment plan. Pupils are well cared for in House with many minor illnesses. However, if they have diarrhoea and vomiting our expectation is that they are removed from College as soon as possible after they develop symptoms. This may mean that guardians have to collect pupils and care for them until well enough to return. Therefore, please ensure that guardians are aware of this and live within a reasonable radius of College. The unwell pupil will need to stay away from College until they have been clear of all symptoms for 48 hours. This is in accordance with Public Health England Recommendations and is aimed at preventing outbreaks of infectious diseases that can greatly affect a boarding community. Communication If two-way communication between home and school works well everything runs more smoothly. The obvious link in this chain is the pupil, but on occasions this is not as reliable as we would like and Matron should also be kept informed of changes to your child’s health. If you are sending an email regarding your child’s health to Matron or their Housemaster or Housemistress, please copy to : nurses@ cheltenhamcollege.org . Holiday Treatment If your child should need treatment during the holidays, this may be arranged with your family doctor as a ‘temporary resident’. If your child has any operation, accident, severe illness or is given vaccinations, please notify the Matron on return to school and inform the Health Centre, preferably in writing. This is especially important to"}

This is especially important to ensure that vaccinations are not duplicated, and to ensure that any medication is safely administered as intended. If your child returns to school with medication, please hand this to the Matron, who will dispense appropriately. We ask that all medication is signed in with Matron, in certain cases Self Medication Forms can be signed and the pupil can keep their own supply of medication. This needs to be authorised via the Health Centre. This is to protect both your child and others.

Founded in 1841 as part of Cheltenham College, it became a separate school in 1909. The pre-preparatory department opened in 1993, and the school became fully co-educational in 1998. A single governing body oversees the school and Cheltenham College, which was inspected separately at the same time. The head of the college has overall responsibility for both schools. Boarders are accommodated in a single boarding house.1.2The school comprises two sections: the pre-prep, which includes the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), for pupils in Nursery to Year 2; and the prep, for pupils in Years 3 to 8.1.3Since the previous inspection the school has built a woodland nursery school and new changing rooms.What the school seeks to do1.4The school aims to equip pupils to lead fulfilled and purposeful lives, with a commitment to the service of others. It intends to provide an excellent all-round education founded on Christian principles and foster intellectual curiosity, academic rigour, independent learning and interests beyond the academic.About the pupils1.5Most pupils live within a 20-mile radius of the school or are boarders. The school’s own assessment data indicate that the ability of pupils is above average compared to those taking the same tests nationally. The school has identified 117 pupils as having special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND), which include elements of potential neurodiversity, of whom 82 receive additional specialist support. No pupil has an education, health and care (EHC) plan. English is an additional language (EAL) for 16 pupils, of whom 12 receive support for their English. The curriculum is modified for pupils identified as being the most able in the school’s population as well as for pupils identified as having special talents in drama, art, music, design technology, computing and sport. Regulatory Compliance Inspection5 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2023Cheltenham College Preparatory School – April 20232.Regulatory Compliance InspectionPrefaceThe Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) is approved by the Secretary of State to inspect schools which are, or whose heads are, in membership of the associations which form the Independent Schools Council (ISC) and report on the extent to which they meet the Independent School Standards (‘the standards’) in the Schedule to the Education (Independent School Standards) Regulations 2014, including the National Minimum Standards for Boarding (‘boarding NMS’), where applicable. Inspections of schools with early years settings not requiring registration also report whether the school complies with key provisions of the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) statutory framework, and for registered settings the full range of the Early Years Foundation Stage provisions is considered. Additionally, inspections report on the school’s accessibility plan under Schedule 10 of the Equality Act 2010 and the ban on corporal punishment under section 548 of the Education Act 1996. Inspections also comment on the progress made to meet any compliance action points set out in the school’s most recent statutory inspection.ISI inspections are also carried out under the arrangements of the ISC Associations for the maintenance and improvement of the quality of their membership.This is a FOCUSED COMPLIANCE INSPECTION which was combined"}

Inspections also comment on the progress made to meet any compliance action points set out in the school’s most recent statutory inspection.ISI inspections are also carried out under the arrangements of the ISC Associations for the maintenance and improvement of the quality of their membership.This is a FOCUSED COMPLIANCE INSPECTION which was combined with an inspection of EDUCATIONAL QUALITY. The FOCUSED COMPLIANCE inspection reports only on the school’s compliance with the standards, including the boarding NMS. The standards represent minimum requirements and judgements are given either as met or as not met. All schools are required to meet all the standards applicable to them. Where the minimum requirements are not met, this is clearly indicated in the relevant section of the report and the school is required to take the actions specified. In this focused compliance inspection, key standards have been inspected in detail. These are the standards on safeguarding; measures to guard against bullying; arrangements for pupils’ health and safety; arrangements to check the suitability of staff; the provision of information; the handling of parents’ complaints; and other related aspects of leadership and management. The remaining standards and requirements are deemed to continue to be met unless evidence to the contrary has been found.Inspections do not include matters that are outside of the regulatory framework described above, such as: an exhaustive health and safety audit; compliance with data protection requirements; an in-depth examination of the structural condition of the school, its services or other physical features; contractual arrangements with parents; an investigation of the financial viability of the school or its accounting procedures.Inspectors may be aware of individual safeguarding concerns, allegations and complaints as part of the inspection process. Such matters will not usually be referred to specifically in published reports in this document but will have been considered by the team in reaching its judgements.Links to the standards and requirements can be found here: The Education (Independent School Standards) Regulations 2014, National Minimum Standards for Boarding Schools, Early Years Foundation Stage Statutory Framework. Regulatory Compliance Inspection6 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2023Cheltenham College Preparatory School – April 2023Key findings2.1The school meets the standards in the schedule to the Education (Independent School Standards) Regulations 2014, the National Minimum Standards for Boarding Schools 2022, and relevant requirements of the statutory framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage, and associated requirements, and no further action is required as a result of this inspection.PART 1 – Quality of education provided2.2The school’s own framework for assessment confirms that teaching enables pupils to make good progress in the context of Part 1 paragraph 3(a).2.3The curriculum is documented, supported by appropriate plans and schemes of work for the pupils and covers the required breadth of material. The teaching enables pupils to make good progress, encompasses effective behaviour management and is supported by suitable resources. A suitable framework for the assessment of pupils’ performance is in place. Boarders have access to a suitable programme of activities.2.4Pupils receive relationships education up to Year 6 and relationships and sex education in Years 7 and 8, except in so far as they are lawfully excused. The school has consulted parents and published a written statement of its policy which has regard to the relevant statutory guidance.2.5The standards relating to the quality of education [paragraphs 1–4] are met.PART 2 – Spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils2.6Principles and values are actively promoted which facilitate the personal development of pupils as responsible, tolerant, law-abiding citizens. Boarders’ views are actively encouraged, and their opinions and concerns are appropriately considered by staff.

Educational Quality Inspection8 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2023Cheltenham College Preparatory School – April 20233.Educational Quality InspectionPrefaceThe EDUCATIONAL QUALITY inspection reports on the quality of the school’s work. It focuses on the two key outcomes:-The achievement of the pupils, including their academic development, and-The personal development of the pupils.The headline judgements apply one of the ISI descriptors ‘excellent’, ‘good’, ‘sound’ or ‘unsatisfactory’.Where necessary, National Curriculum nomenclature is used to refer to year groups in the school.Key findings3.1The quality of the pupils’ academic and other achievements is excellent.\u0002Pupils from the very youngest demonstrate an excitement to learn, curiosity and excellent attitudes towards their learning.\u0002Pupils have outstanding communication skills; they listen attentively, write with flair and accuracy and are extremely confident and articulate speakers.\u0002Pupils demonstrate strong knowledge, skills and understanding across the range of subjects and apply them extremely effectively.\u0002Pupils successfully apply their excellent numeracy skills to other areas of the curriculum.\u0002Boarders’ excellent achievement is significantly enhanced by the support they receive.3.2The quality of the pupils’ personal development is excellent.\u0002Pupils are reflective and self-assured, able to review and improve, and they are well-prepared for the next stage of their education.\u0002All pupils demonstrate outstanding levels of self-awareness, self-confidence, and resilience because of their warm relationships with teachers and leaders.\u0002Pupils have excellent social skills, respect each other and have a strong sense of belonging.\u0002Pupils have a strong understanding of and a commitment to celebrating diversity.Recommendation3.3The school is advised to make the following improvement.\u0002Further strengthen pupils’ ability to think deeply by consistently providing opportunities to hypothesise, analyse and synthesise independently.The quality of the pupils’ academic and other achievements3.4The quality of the pupils’ academic and other achievements is excellent.3.5Pupils demonstrate outstanding attitudes to learning, strongly fulfilling the school’s aims. In lessons and in the high-quality presentation of their work, pupils show high levels of commitment and enthusiasm. They cooperate well with one another and have a positive ‘can do’ approach in lessons and extra-curricular activities. They concentrate and persevere with tasks because teaching constantly encourages and celebrates success. Across the school pupils are keen to do their very best. This was Educational Quality Inspection9 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2023Cheltenham College Preparatory School – April 2023clearly demonstrated in a Latin lesson, when pupils in Year 7, worked purposefully and collaboratively, showing excellent levels of focus and concentration throughout, to confidently translate sentences from Latin to English. They correctly identified errors in the sentences and explained the reasons for the errors, accurately making links between Latin and English and other languages. Boarders develop increasing confidence and independence as a result of the emphasis in the boarding house of self-organisation, their organisation and support of younger pupils and encouragement to take initiative in their work and activities. Pupils thrive on challenge, viewing mistakes as learning opportunities in a learning environment in which governors, leadership and teachers have successfully fulfilled the school’s aim to foster intellectual curiosity, academic rigour, independent learning and interests beyond the academic, which bring enjoyment and enrichment.3.6Pupils’ outstanding communication skills are applied and extended in all subjects. They speak with poise and confidence and listen with care and attention. Children in nursery coherently verbalised their play with a tractor, farm animals and figures, using phrases such as"}

They speak with poise and confidence and listen with care and attention. Children in nursery coherently verbalised their play with a tractor, farm animals and figures, using phrases such as ‘we need’, ‘maybe, and ‘I think’. In a physics lesson in Year 8, pupils adeptly employed rhetorical questioning, appropriate pauses, humour, subject specific vocabulary and eye contact to successfully maintain the interest of their peers, delivering presentations of their choice, ranging from neurodiversity to black holes. Boarders readily and capably discussed all aspects of their school experience, the quality of their care and boarding life. In lessons pupils eagerly explain their reasoning in response to teachers’ highly effective questioning. From the EYFS onwards, pupils develop a love of reading and are quickly able to read with understanding and expression. Pupils develop strong writing skills from an early age and writing is fluent, well written for purpose, and applied successfully across the curriculum. Pupils of all abilities make rapid progress in their communication skills, because teaching develops confidence, provides challenge and is well-matched to individual needs.3.7Pupils, including those with SEND, EAL and the more able, make at least good, and often excellent progress over time. High-quality teaching effectively supports pupils’ learning, along with highly effective assessment and tracking, careful planning and early targeted support when required. In the EYFS, children entering with a broad range of ability make rapid progress, so that almost all reach the expected levels of development for their age by the end of Reception. Nationally standardised test data, lesson observations and scrutiny of pupils’ work, show that attainment exceeds national age-related expectations. Most pupils proceed to the senior school or other schools of their choice, with a significant number awarded academic and a variety of other scholarships. Boarders reported that their structured boarding routine and the support that they receive help to improve their academic performance. Responding to the pre-inspection questionnaire, the vast majority of parents agreed that the school enables their child to make progress and that their educational needs are effectively met, and all parents of boarders agreed that the boarding experience helps their child’s progress. Inspection evidence supports this view.3.8Pupils are excellent mathematicians. Core numerical skills are strong in relation to age and are employed successfully across the curriculum. In a history lesson on the Spanish Armada, pupils adeptly applied their mathematical skills when plotting an emotion graph, and pupils in Year 7 described using their knowledge of pi when calculating radius and circumference in design technology (DT), to create bangle designs for a 3D printer. Secure mathematical skills are embedded by teaching which successfully meets the needs of those with particular difficulties as well as providing challenge for the most able. This was particularly evident in a lesson in Reception when all children worked confidently with numbers to 20 and many responded to the challenge to partition larger numbers. Pupils’ excellent problem-solving skills, creative mathematical thinking, making links and reasoning are strategically developed across the curriculum.3.9Pupils of all ages are highly competent users of information and communication technology (ICT), skilfully manipulating a range of digital devices and applications. This results from the commitment and investment of school leaders and governors, who have ensured that this area of the curriculum is extremely well resourced. Pupils programme and design their own websites and apply their ICT skills Educational Quality Inspection10 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2023Cheltenham College Preparatory School – April 2023very effectively to other areas of the curriculum. For example, in an English lesson, pupils in Year 5 were highly proficient using a collaboration platform on their tablets to share ideas while creating a new portmanteau of words in the style of Jabberwocky. Pupils successfully use ICT to support their learning , as seen in the many examples of this in pupils’ books. Pupils in"}

Pupils in Year 7 and 8 commented that the school’s learning platform helped them considerably to consolidate their learning.3.10Pupils attain high levels of knowledge, skills and understanding across all areas of the curriculum, resulting from the high expectations and expertise of the teaching, which challenges them at every step from the EYFS onwards. Children in the EYFS develop secure foundations to their early literacy and numeracy skills and further their knowledge successfully through a range of well-planned, engaging and purposeful activities. In a French lesson in nursery, creative and imaginative teaching engaged the children enabling them to understand and use new words and make rapid progress in their learning. Pupils in Year 2, inspired by the work of the sixteenth century artist Giuseppe Arcimboldo, created excellent collage portraits using fruit and vegetables showing mature skill and understanding of the techniques applied. In a games lesson, pupils in Year 4 made excellent progress perfecting their underarm throws, pointing with the non-throwing arm and slowing the speed of the throw. In a science lesson in pre-prep, pupils working in different ability groups, accurately named and described parts of plants and trees, interested and inspired by the challenging questions of the teaching which encouraged them to work hard and make rapid progress. In an English lesson in Year 8, pupils showed outstanding ability in applying technical vocabulary such as ‘hyperbole’ and ‘personification’ when analysing song lyrics. Pupils with SEND and EAL gain confidence and make consequently excellent academic improvement as a result of well-planned interventions and support. In the questionnaire, the vast majority of pupils agreed that their skills and knowledge improve in most lessons and that their teachers help them to learn.3.11Pupils achieve notable success in a wide range of extra-curricular activities in and out of school as they are actively encouraged to follow individual strengths and passions. Pupils spoke proudly about their own and team achievements and how the school has helped them to be successful. The many opportunities at school, such as playing in fixtures, appearing in plays and performing in concerts, are key factors in pupils’ excellent achievements. As well as celebrating sporting excellence, the ethos is about sport for everyone; all pupils participate and develop skills in their sports of choice. Pupils spoke proudly about their success in matches, in a variety of sports, in school and in local and national competitions. Pupils are highly successful in ABRSM music and LAMDA drama examinations each year, with a high proportion achieving distinctions. The chamber choir, Cantabile, regularly performs Evensong at Cathedrals in nearby cities, and pupils perform in music and drama events in the local Cheltenham Performing Arts Festival. Pupils keenly participate in the Outreach programme, performing with and to pupils from other local schools in music and drama.3.12When opportunities arise, pupils display an excellent range of study skills. Pupils respond positively in activities where they can take a lead in their own learning and when tasks allow independence of thought. Pupils can successfully identify their own strengths and weaknesses when evaluating different statements about themselves and through setting their own targets. By Year 8, they are clearly able to analyse, synthesise and hypothesise, as well as work independently to reach conclusions. The school’s ‘Key Skills and Attributes’ programme, aims to encourage higher-order thinking skills, and in most lessons observed, pupils were encouraged to think for themselves, to question, to challenge, to have a go and not be afraid of making mistakes.The quality of the pupils’ personal development3.13The quality of the pupils’ personal development is excellent.3.14Pupils are extremely confident and self-aware.

They embrace the school ethos which provides a clear framework for personal development and results in pupils who are confident, well-rounded and curious, enabling them to develop into respectful, resilient young people. Pupils’ self-understanding Educational Quality Inspection11 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2023Cheltenham College Preparatory School – April 2023builds as they progress through each section of the school, nurtured by excellent teaching and pastoral support. The governance and leadership are highly successful in creating the space and the time for pupils to develop excellent personal skills and self-awareness. Pupils confidently set personal targets and show a genuine awareness of how to improve. They are keen to try out new challenges, embracing opportunities to self-evaluate and self-correct when required.3.15Pupils increasingly develop the ability to make important decisions maturely and reflectively, understanding that the decisions they make have an impact on their lives and success. Younger pupils readily make sensible choices in their activities and play because of the gentle encouragement of their teachers. Pupils relish the choices they are given in lessons to take on challenging tasks that are suited to their ability. Pupils in Year 3 confidently chose which skills to focus on during a computing lesson, according to how confident they felt in various areas. In a Year 3 mathematics lesson pupils made decisions as to which method, column or number line, they would use to find the solution. Boarders talked about the need for them to make appropriate decisions on a daily basis, choosing different activities, managing their time effectively, or choosing to do the right thing in terms of their social relationships within the close-knit community of their boarding house.3.16Pupils demonstrate a strong awareness of spirituality and a keen appreciation of the non-material. For instance, pupils in Year 6 were engrossed in their meditation session and pupils in Year 3 told special messages to a little tree in outdoor learning. Pupils employ mindfulness techniques and appreciate the opportunities in outdoor learning to connect with nature, deepening their appreciation of it. Choristers insightfully explained that being around people who love the same thing gives them a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing, and that they experience feelings when they sing together that they don't get elsewhere. Teachers, leaders and governors, have developed strategies through the personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education programme which encourage pupils to form their own opinions to consider and discuss a variety of spiritual, musical, artistic and religious topics. From the EYFS onwards, children learn how to take time to reflect on their own wellbeing and practise strategies such as mindfulness and yoga to introduce calm in their daily lives. Weekly chapel services also offer pupils the opportunity for quiet reflection. In conversations at lunch, older pupils explained how much they valued these occasions to be quiet and to appreciate music and ideas. Pupils’ excellent artwork and writing on display, in classrooms and in other areas clearly illustrate that the pupils think deeply about the non-material aspects of life.3.17Pupils demonstrate high levels of moral awareness. The development of pupils’ strong sense of right and wrong begins in the EYFS where they learn to understand the impact of their actions on others, and acts of kindness are recognised. Pupils’ behaviour is excellent, as a result effective strategies and strong pastoral leadership. Pupils are kind and supportive of each other, sensitively recognising when children with SEND may need a specially considered approach. They are respectful of rules, of adults and peers and they accept responsibility for their own behaviour. Empathy skills are taught effectively, and this encourages pupils to think about the effect on others of their behaviour and come to their own conclusions about causes"}

They are respectful of rules, of adults and peers and they accept responsibility for their own behaviour. Empathy skills are taught effectively, and this encourages pupils to think about the effect on others of their behaviour and come to their own conclusions about causes and consequences. In a scholarship lesson, pupils used these skills extremely effectively to think about and prepare presentations on horse psychology, music and mental health, and whether all children should be eligible for free school meals. In interviews pupils said that they regard members of staff and older pupils as role models and respect them. Pupils say they want to be the best they can be and consistently exhibit the traits of kindness and respecting others, reflecting the highly positive school ethos.3.18Pupils’ social awareness is excellent, resulting in a happy atmosphere throughout the school. Pupils work extremely well together, in lessons, house meetings, school council or eco-committee towards common goals. In the pre-prep, collaboration amongst the pupils comes very naturally and is evident in all they do. For example, pupils take turns fairly when playing mathematics games, or sharing resources in child-initiated activities, working productively together to create a river and bridge in outdoor learning. Throughout the school, within sports teams, on stage and musically, there is a vibrant sense of collaboration and working with, and for, one another. Boarders say that they value Educational Quality Inspection12 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2023Cheltenham College Preparatory School – April 2023the very strong team spirit and sense of community within the boarding house and being part of a boarding house ‘family’. This consists of vertical groups of five pupils who do activities together, have meals together and compete for the highly prized ‘Family of the Week’ trophy. In their questionnaire responses, almost all parents agreed that the school helps their child to develop strong teamwork and social skills.3.19Pupils readily take responsibility for others. They are highly committed to their houses as evidenced in their house meetings and contribute positively to the wider life of the school. The house system allows pupils to work together and support each other in various challenges as was seen in their enthusiastic, highly organised preparation for the house singing competition. Pupils from Year 3 to Year 8 represent their peers as members of the school council. This is effective in giving the pupils a chance to give opinions and sometimes initiate change in the school, such as the recent change to the upper school reward system to include the awarding of vouchers for the coffee shop. Year 8 pupils support children in the pre-school in their reading sessions. Pupils share in each other’s success and there is a palpable sense of community and caring. Pupils are extremely pro-active in supporting many charities which they are involved in selecting. Through the ‘Chadwick Leadership Programme’, pupils in Year 8 contribute to both the school and the wider community, undertaking a range of activities which include working with partner primary schools, raising funds for charities such as the local animal sanctuary and clearing overgrown local footpaths. They keenly take responsibility to lead various projects with confidence, such as sports festivals and musical performances.3.20Pupils have a strong understanding of and a commitment to celebrating diversity. They are sensitive to and tolerant of those from backgrounds and traditions different to their own, particularly in boarding where some pupils come from a range of countries around the world. Boarders commented positively about how much they value and appreciate the diversity in the boarding community and the social opportunities it provides. Pupils talked positively about how they celebrate each other’s cultures in assemblies and through the activities in the boarding house. Pupils enjoy listening to individuals explain about their religions. For example, pupils in Year 7 brought in family artefacts to help explain about Jewish festivals. Pupils commented that they were looking forward to welcoming"}

Pupils enjoy listening to individuals explain about their religions. For example, pupils in Year 7 brought in family artefacts to help explain about Jewish festivals. Pupils commented that they were looking forward to welcoming a group of Japanese students to the school for a few days. The PSHE and theology, philosophy and ethics (TPE) programmes develop a broad awareness of different religions, cultures and traditions, and pupils learn to be considerate and to celebrate differences. Displays of pupils’ work around the school depict pupils’ high sense of awareness and knowledge of diversity. There is a strong awareness of people who are neurodiverse and those from the LGBTQ+ communities, and pupils understand how to interact sensitively with those with SEND and EAL. The open and friendly ethos promoted by governors and senior leaders supports this, and underpins the highly positive relationships between everyone, which is a strong aspect of the school. Pupils reported in interviews that everyone feels valued in the school community. Almost all parents responding to the questionnaire agreed that the school actively promotes values of respect and tolerance of other people.3.21Pupils have a mature appreciation about how to stay safe and physically and mentally healthy, particularly in terms of diet, exercise and a balanced life-style. Pupils say that they feel cared for, well-prepared for life, and understand how to keep themselves safe in many difference contexts, including when online. They know how and where to seek help if they are worried or anxious. This was strongly emphasised by pupils in discussion, who spoke with enthusiasm about how well they are supported and advised by the school and their teachers. In an ICT lesson, pupils were able to identify the features of potential scams, such as emails from your bank asking for details, or if the senders address does not correspond to previous ones, it is probably ‘phishing’. The vast majority of parents responding to the questionnaire agreed that the school encourages their child to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Pupils said that they feel extremely well-supported through the school’s PSHE and relationships and sex education (RSE) programmes, and their strong relationships with their teachers. Inspection Evidence13 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2023Cheltenham College Preparatory School – April 20234.Inspection Evidence4.1The inspectors observed lessons, had discussions with pupils and examined samples of pupils’ work.

It is a registered charity, which is overseen by a board of governors known as the Council. The school was established in 1841, as a school for boys, founded on Christian principles. Girls were admitted into the sixth form in 1981 and the school became fully co-educational in 1998. The school has eleven houses, two of which are for day pupils only, whilst the others provide for a mix of full and part-time boarders. What the school seeks to do 1.2 The school aims to equip pupils to lead purposeful and fulfilling lives by providing an excellent all- round education, which is founded on Christian principles. The school fosters intellectual curiosity, talents beyond the academic sphere, skills for a modern world and a commitment to the service of others, as well as the development of spiritual, moral and aesthetic awareness within themselves. About the pupils 1.3 Day pupils come from families with a range of backgrounds, living within a 20-mile radius of the school. Boarders come largely from the United Kingdom, with about a fifth living overseas. Standardised test data provided by the school indicate that the ability of the pupils is broadly average. The school has identified 105 pupils as having special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND), mainly for issues related to dyslexia, 42 of whom receive additional support. No pupil currently has an educational, health and care (EHC) plan. English is an additional language (EAL) for 160 pupils, of whom 72 receive additional support. The school identifies 76 pupils as being the most able in its population and provides a programme of enrichment for all pupils through a wide range of activities and opportunities, both inside and outside the classroom.

Inspections also comment on the progress made to meet any compliance action points set out in the school’s most recent statutory inspection. ISI inspections are also carried out under the arrangements of the ISC Associations for the maintenance and improvement of the quality of their membership. This is a FOCUSED COMPLIANCE INSPECTION which was combined with an inspection of EDUCATIONAL QUALITY. The FOCUSED COMPLIANCE inspection reports only on the school’s compliance with the standards, including the boarding NMS. The standards represent minimum requirements and judgements are given either as met or as not met. All schools are required to meet all the standards applicable to them. Where the minimum requirements are not met, this is clearly indicated in the relevant section of the report and the school is required to take the actions specified. In this focused compliance inspection, key standards have been inspected in detail. These are the standards on safeguarding; measures to guard against bullying; arrangements for pupils’ health and safety; arrangements to check the suitability of staff; the provision of information; the handling of parents’ complaints; and other related aspects of leadership and management. The remaining standards and requirements are deemed to continue to be met unless evidence to the contrary has been found. Inspections do not include matters that are outside of the regulatory framework described above, such as: an exhaustive health and safety audit; compliance with data protection requirements; an in-depth examination of the structural condition of the school, its services or other physical features; contractual arrangements with parents; an investigation of the financial viability of the school or its accounting procedures. Inspectors may be aware of individual safeguarding concerns, allegations and complaints as part of the inspection process. Such matters will not usually be referred to specifically in published reports in this document but will have been considered by the team in reaching its judgements.

Educational Quality Inspection 8 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2023 Cheltenham College – April 20233. Educational Quality Inspection Preface The EDUCATIONAL QUALITY inspection reports on the quality of the school’s work. It focuses on the two key outcomes: -The achievement of the pupils, including their academic development, and -The personal development of the pupils. The headline judgements apply one of the ISI descriptors ‘excellent’, ‘good’, ‘sound’ or ‘unsatisfactory’. Where necessary, National Curriculum nomenclature is used to refer to year groups in the school. Where the school’s own names differ from those used nationally, the details are given in the table below: School name National Curriculum name 3rd Form Year 9 4th Form Year 10 5th Form Year 11 Lower 6th Form Year 12 Upper 6th Form Year 13 Key findings 3.1 The quality of the pupils’ academic and other achievements is excellent.  Pupils make excellent progress in developing a wide range of knowledge, skills and understanding.  Pupils are excellent communicators; in particular they are articulate and expressive speakers and respectful listeners.  Pupils’ application of information and communication technology (ICT) skills across all subjects is outstanding.  Pupils’ achievements beyond the classroom are wide-ranging and sometimes at the very highest level.  Pupils’ attitudes to learning are excellent. 3.2 The quality of the pupils’ personal development is excellent.  Pupils display high levels of self-understanding and develop a mature sense of resilience.  Pupils’ spiritual awareness and appreciation of the non-material aspects of life are extremely well developed.  Pupils’ social and collaboration skills in academic and social settings are excellent.  Pupils contribute highly effectively to others, the school and wider community is excellent. Educational Quality Inspection 9 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2023 Cheltenham College – April 2023Recommendations 3.3 The school is advised to make the following improvements.  Enable all pupils to maximise their academic outcomes, building on the existing successes of those experiences where pupils’ ownership of their learning is most evident. The quality of the pupils’ academic and other achievements 3.4 The quality of the pupils’ academic and other achievements is excellent. 3.5 The school wholeheartedly fulfils its aim to equip pupils to lead purposeful and fulfilling lives by providing an excellent all-round education. Pupils’ strong academic progress, both within lessons and over time, is clearly evident in their academic outcomes. This is as a result of the commitment of governors, senior leaders, passionate teachers and highly supportive house staff to ensure every pupil achieves at least their potential, and often beyond it. Frequent and highly detailed tracking and monitoring procedures provide staff with insightful and valuable information leading to targeted interventions which contribute to value being added to most pupils’ progress. SEND pupils make sound progress"}

Pupils’ strong academic progress, both within lessons and over time, is clearly evident in their academic outcomes.

Frequent and highly detailed tracking and monitoring procedures provide staff with insightful and valuable information leading to targeted interventions which contribute to value being added to most pupils’ progress. SEND pupils make sound progress in line with their potential whilst EAL pupils make exceptional progress over their time in the school. Female pupils make significantly better progress than male pupils in Years 9 to 11, but this levels out in the sixth form. 3.6 Pupils’ attainment at A level in 2022 was strong. The majority achieved A* to C grades and over half achieved the top two grades. These results are lower than the centre- and teacher-assessed results in 2020 and 2021 but significantly higher than the results in 2019. At GCSE, three-fifths of pupils achieved the top three grades: lower than the centre- and teacher-assessed results in 2020 and 2021 and the results in 2019. Pupils with SEND perform less successfully than their peers at GCSE but by A Level, their performance matches that of their peers. The majority of pupils gain entry to their first-choice universities at a wide range of institutions in the UK, USA and Canada to study a broad range of subjects. A number of candidates regularly secure scholarships and places at universities with highly competitive entry requirements. Most pupils who responded to the pre-inspection questionnaire feel their teachers are supportive, know their subjects well, and know how to help them learn. 3.7 Pupils develop an excellent range of knowledge, skills and understanding across a broad range of subjects. This is as a result of well scaffolded and differentiated teaching. In the questionnaires, most parents feel their children’s particular individual educational needs are met effectively. For example, pupils with EAL in Year 11, recalled and developed their knowledge of A Journey’s End to excellent effect, improving their aesthetic understanding of the play and its key themes. Pupils in Year 10 extended their English vocabulary to describe techniques in poetry such as metaphor, caesura, ellipsis and onomatopoeia when analysing Carol Ann Duffy’s love poetry. In a politics lesson, pupils in Year 12 recalled their knowledge of the Human Rights Act, the Supreme Court and the House of Lords to argue the extent of Labour’s success in constitutional reform. Pupils in Year 13 ably applied the principles of Lenz’s law in physics to determine the induction of a wire’s current by an oscillating magnetic field. 3.8 Pupils develop excellent communication skills throughout the school. They relish regular opportunities to discuss and debate in lessons. For example, in theology, philosophy and ethics, pupils in Year 9 considered how The Matrix relates to Plato’s allegory of the cave. In music, pupils in Year 11 asked insightful and well-considered questions to cement their understanding of Paul Simon’s Graceland, evidencing their excellent technical knowledge through accurate use of specialist subject terminology. In economics, pupils in Year 12 discussed the reasons for unemployment in the UK using sophisticated macroeconomic phraseology. Pupils in Year 13 explained why certain behaviour is appropriate for specific parts of a play and how it is portrayed through tone, body language and eye contact. Pupils listen extremely attentively to their teachers and peers whilst in lessons and discussions, and are exemplary in their active and supportive appreciation of their peers. The quality of pupils’ reading Educational Quality Inspection 10 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2023 Cheltenham College – April 2023develops throughout their time in the school, and this is epitomised in the inspiring atmosphere created by pupil-led readings and speeches in chapel. 3.9 Pupils apply their strong numeracy skills across a range of subjects in the curriculum. For example, pupils in Year 9 confidently calculated dimensions in design technology projects, and pupils in Year 10 correctly calculated the surface area of a cylindrical shape to make a bottle cover in textiles. In computer"}

For example, pupils in Year 9 confidently calculated dimensions in design technology projects, and pupils in Year 10 correctly calculated the surface area of a cylindrical shape to make a bottle cover in textiles. In computer science, pupils in Year 11 confidently used strong mental mathematics skills in converting hexadecimal, denary and binary forms. In economics, pupils in Year 12 effectively used equations to manipulate costs, revenues and profits to answer an examination style question. 3.10 Pupils’ use of information and communication technology (ICT) is outstanding. Its widespread and highly effective use in a broad range of academic and pastoral situations supports pupils’ learning and helps them to organise their lives more effectively. Teaching encourages frequent and judicious use of devices and the natural, everyday approach to ICT is embedded in most aspects of school life. For example, pupils use QR codes as links from their exercise books to relevant material on the internet. Pupils in all years develop their ICT skills in music in a variety of highly successful ways. They use an online platform to store and organise their work and make extremely effective use of complex software to compose music of high quality. Likewise, sophisticated software aids their design and execution of highly detailed work in art, design technology, graphics and textiles, such as three- dimensional printing and digital embroidery. 3.11 Pupils display excellent study skills in many subjects. The foundation project qualification programme in Year 9 enables pupils to develop exceptionally strong study skills using a variety of media. Examples of extended research pieces include a study of world leaders’ responses to a well-considered questionnaire about their contribution to solving global poverty and another piece guides future sheep farmers in the skills of lambing. Pupils in Year 11 deftly analysed themes and quotes across a wide range of sources enabling them to synthesise their learning in Greek. Their excellent analysis of texts enabled them to draw upon previous learning in order to synthesise questions incorporating points, explanations, examples, and justification of their hypotheses. In chemistry, pupils in Year 12 applied their knowledge of ionisation energies to complete Born-Haber cycles explaining why certain compounds cannot exist. Pupils in Year 13 carried out detailed analysis of Oedipus Rex, citing relevant and appropriate quotes to support their conclusions and justify their written statements. Pupils in Year 12 have the opportunity to develop the independent research skills started in Year 9 through the extended project qualification programme leading to extended essays or artefacts. Pupils investigated an exceptionally broad range of topics and their outcomes included essays on the use of pronouns, a project looking at the fate of Jews in South Africa, a study of the process of learning a musical instrument from scratch, and the design and creation of swimwear for women who have had a mastectomy. These high levels of independent learning are sometimes less evident where pupils rely upon teacher input rather than intrinsic motivation. Pupils exhibit notably advanced research skills enabling them to demonstrate secure ownership of their own learning. Almost all parents who completed the questionnaires feel the school equips their children with the collaborative and research skills they need in later life and most pupils feel their teachers' feedback helps them to improve. 3.12 In line with the school’s aims, pupils are enriched by their achievements in an exceptionally broad range of activities beyond the classroom. Four-fifths of pupils wholeheartedly participate in the extensive programme of sports fixtures as members of 130 teams across 15 sports, including hockey, rugby, cricket, netball, polo, rackets and equestrian pursuits. Individual pupils achieve exceptional successes at an elite level, including membership of county and national teams in all of these sports. Two-thirds of pupils participate in the school’s well-established community projects, including The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award (DofE) scheme, and a third of all"}

Two-thirds of pupils participate in the school’s well-established community projects, including The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award (DofE) scheme, and a third of all pupils opt to join the Combined Cadet Force (CCF), where they develop exceptionally strong teamwork, resourcefulness, self-reliance, communication and leadership skills. Music is of pivotal importance to school life. Pupils perform in a range of choirs, orchestras and other instrumental ensembles and their singing en masse in chapel is extraordinarily robust. Individuals are successful in nationally assessed music examinations with over Educational Quality Inspection 11 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2023 Cheltenham College – April 2023two-thirds gaining distinctions; three-quarters of these are grade seven and above. Pupils regularly win organ and choral scholarships to UK universities and cathedrals, and individual successes have been celebrated in recent years as Gloucestershire Young Musicians of the Year. Three-quarters of pupils studying national drama and speaking examinations attain distinctions. Pupils of all ages are able to develop their dramatic skills through their participation in one or more of the seven annual productions, including a performance in a local professional theatre and major productions involving nearly 100 pupils, for example the recent success, Grease. Pupils’ academic accomplishments are further expanded upon through their success in a wide range of national competitions. Pupils regularly win awards in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, speaking, writing and French debating. 3.13 Pupils’ attitudes to learning are generally excellent. Most pupils are consistently positive, motivated, prepared and ambitious to learn. They understand the impact of their learning on their futures. This positivity is occasionally tempered by some pupils’ passivity in lessons, allowing their teachers to take the lead and responsibility for their progress rather than embracing ownership themselves. Pupils particularly enjoy challenges that allow them to use and develop a range of skills; encourage them to work collaboratively; and enable them to pursue their own interests. Pupils enjoy researching a range of topics. For example, the effectiveness of tanks in modern warfare, such as in the Donbas at the time of the inspection, supported by real-time communication with the Royal Tank Regiment. Many pupils demonstrate positive leadership of their learning through the research they conduct in preparation for societies or clubs outside their lessons and beyond the curriculum, for example, the chemistry society, the drama society and their involvement in Model United Nations (MUN). The quality of the pupils’ personal development 3.14 The quality of the pupils’ personal development is excellent. 3.15 Pupils display high levels of self-understanding, self-esteem and self-confidence within the classroom and more widely around the school. They develop resilience through their endeavours in team and individual sports and other extra-curricular activities. Pupils acknowledge the important benefits they gain through the support of their teachers. Pupils exemplified this when considering that deselection from a team is seen, not as a permanent set-back, but as an opportunity to show determination to win back the place. Pupils further develop their mature sense of independence through their boarding experience where they are well known by the staff as individuals and feel supported as a result. Pupils in Year 9 gain early opportunities to develop their self-knowledge through participation in a boarders’ leadership programme. This encourages pupils to carry out essential house duties, for example, wake- up, which promotes a feeling of self-worth and contributes to the palpable sense of community. 3.16 Pupils develop excellent decision-making skills and are able to think for themselves and make well- judged choices in many aspects of their busy lives. They recognise and value opportunities to make decisions that will influence their futures. For example, they choose to attend additional academic clinics, seek support with A-level choices, attend ‘futures weeks’ and choose to get involved in CCF and sports teams. Additionally, pupils appreciate the school’s efforts to"}

For example, they choose to attend additional academic clinics, seek support with A-level choices, attend ‘futures weeks’ and choose to get involved in CCF and sports teams. Additionally, pupils appreciate the school’s efforts to support their decision-making through a range of focused careers events and programmes, for example, an annual universities fair and travel awards in Year 12. In the boarding houses, pupils are empowered to decide which charity to support and they make mature and well-informed judgements when arriving at their final choices. In the questionnaires, most parents feel that pupils receive regular and helpful information on their child's performance and progress and most pupils agree that they receive helpful advice about subject choices and careers. 3.17 Pupils’ spiritual understanding is excellent. Chapel sits at the heart of school life and presents pupils with regular opportunities to reflect, celebrate and contemplate their community through scripture readings, hymn singing and pupil-led homilies and addresses. Pupils have a strong appreciation of the architecture and setting of their school. They are highly cognisant of the school’s historical sacrifice in the First World War as they regularly gaze upon the memorial in chapel to the fallen Cheltonians. They Educational Quality Inspection 12 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2023 Cheltenham College – April 2023feel this affords them a sense of serenity in their busy lives. Pupils are eager to show their support and enthusiasm for the arts in all senses. They support and attend productions, concerts and exhibitions. For example, pupils were excited about a forthcoming performance by a school jazz ensemble at the Cheltenham Jazz festival. In the classroom, pupils develop their appreciation of spiritual awareness. For example, pupils in Year 10 reflected maturely in Latin on the nature of unrequited love, noting its connections to English expressions and, in doing so, deepening their appreciation of the power love can exert on the human state. Pupils’ understanding of the significance of the non-material aspects of life is evident in their enjoyment of their relationships with one another, their appreciation of the natural world and of the real and perceived privileges they share. 3.18 Pupils demonstrate excellent standards of behaviour throughout the school. They are courteous and sensitive to the feelings of others and have a healthy respect for their peers and teachers. Pupils recognise the need for a system of rewards and sanctions and value the opportunity to work within this. They appreciate that the school rewards positive conduct, not just academic achievement. Pupils’ expression of pride in their school is exemplified by the wearing of highly sought after ties which recognise their contribution to societies, subjects and charitable service. When their behaviour occasionally dips below the expected standards, pupils respond well to the restorative approach to reparation which is well embedded in the school and house cultures. Pupils are keen to ensure their behaviour represents the well-established values espoused by the school, and they demonstrate much consideration when they annually review their individual house’s values. In the questionnaires, almost all parents and pupils agree that the school expects pupils to behave well. Most pupils feel that their voices are heard, allowing them to offer their opinions and concerns relating to different aspects of school life. This has allowed pupils to develop greater respect for the school’s rules as well as when decisions are made which have a direct impact on them. 3.19 Pupils’ social development and collaboration are excellent. They base their approach on the school’s ethos of curiosity, creativity, character, community and continuous excellence. Pupils demonstrate these qualities aptly through their passionate involvement in various programmes, for example, MUN DofE and the CCF. In the classroom, pupils understand the benefits of collaboration. For example, pupils in Year 10 worked effectively in pairs in Latin, supporting each other with translation exercises and, in doing so, recognising the"}

In the classroom, pupils understand the benefits of collaboration. For example, pupils in Year 10 worked effectively in pairs in Latin, supporting each other with translation exercises and, in doing so, recognising the strengths that their partners brought to the task. Boarders work together in a highly co-operative manner. They use formal systems of peer mentoring, prefects and buddies but also develop effective habits of looking out for one another, offering help and behaving in a socially constructive manner. They particularly enjoy working across the age groups as demonstrated in the vertical house families, clans, tribes and huddles where they spend time together on social activities, playing games, cooking, eating and sharing experiences. 3.20 Pupils embrace and value the diversity in their school and cite the cultural week as a reflection of how they celebrate difference. The Floreat programme (personal, social and health education), house competitions, celebration weeks, Pride picnic, anti-racism group, and international days, all serve to celebrate the cultural diversity of the college and are warmly welcomed by the pupil body. Pupils are keen to help the school to move forward with initiatives which support anti-racism and LGBTQ+ issues. Pupils feel that it is only through having an appreciation of each other’s personal experiences that equality and equity can be achieved. They develop their broader understanding of others through finding out about their peers’ countries, cultures, backgrounds and interests. 3.21 Pupils feel safe within school, especially in their boarding houses, and in the virtual world. Pupils are assiduous about observing the very clear road safety protocols at the crossings and maintaining vigilance around the site. Pupils understand the importance of choosing nutritious food at mealtimes as part of a balanced lifestyle. They take advantage of the range of opportunities to do physical exercise throughout the week and recognise that sport is also a social activity, which is vital to contributing to good mental health. Pupils respect how the Floreat and chapel programmes deal with a wide range of issues concerning, for example, relationships and sex, racism, female genital mutilation and staying safe online. They also appreciate that these programmes tackle safety issues Educational Quality Inspection 13 © Independent Schools Inspectorate 2023 Cheltenham College – April 2023beyond school, for example keeping safe when attending music festivals. Pupils highly value, and make regular use of, the excellent health centre which provides physical and mental health support for pupils. Almost all parents who responded to the questionnaires agreed that the school keeps their children safe and the vast majority of pupils feel the school is a safe place to be. 3.22 Pupils' contribution to others, the school and wider community is excellent. Around a quarter of pupils in Year 13 occupy positions of responsibility to form a pupil leadership team which works closely with the school’s senior leaders. They take full responsibility for the entire school charity programme and annually raise large sums of money. More than two-fifths of pupils in Year 12 undertake dedicated community placements in local schools, charity shops, hospitals and homes for the elderly. Through these endeavours, pupils develop a greater awareness of the wider socioeconomic society and understand the important contribution they can make. A number of pupils continue to support their own local projects after they leave school. House initiatives encourage pupils to serve at a local foodbank and visit elderly residents. Prefects develop excellent listening skills, conflict resolution strategies, and experiences of planning and delivering projects. In the questionnaires, nearly all parents agree that the school helps their child to develop strong teamwork and social skills. Successful fulfilment of the school’s aims is exemplified in the pupils’ development of skills for a modern world and a commitment to the service of others.

Meet Ngoni “I joined Cheltenham College in Third Form, having also been to Cheltenham Prep School. I chose College due the support that is given to help you strive in all areas, whether it is in academics, sports, music, drama and art. What drew me to College the most was the pastoral care . Being an international student, College truly does their best to make it a home away from home. Teachers have helped me the most academically by pushing me outside of my comfort zone to reach my fullest potential. Most importantly, academic societies are the best place to further your understanding by encouraging important discussions about the subjects and its influence in the modern world. It is also a great place to ask questions that you are unable to ask in a classroom environment.” Meet Ed “Since the age of three, I have been part of the College community, having been to The Prep.

When looking at joining College, t he sport was really appealing to me, and the coaches at College made this decision even easier. Academics wise I knew that College had lots of options for GCSEs and A Levels. I am currently studying Sport Science, History, Business, and I completed the EPQ last year. When I leave College, I am going to be going to u niversity in the USA on a r ugby scholarship, and hopefully be part of something special at Lindenwood University, Missouri. Personally, I think the opportunities at College to try new things, meet new people, and make new connections is what makes it so special, and sets it apart from anywhere else.” Meet Grace “I joined Cheltenham College for Sixth Form, because I wanted a change from my previous school. With all on offer at College, it seemed like it would allow me to challenge myself and grow – as it has done. I am now studying Maths, Economics and Politics at A Level. The best thing about College to me is my boarding house. I may be biased but Chandos is the best, it feels more like a home and I will truly miss it when I leave. I have had a wonderful experience at College and I will be sad to leave.” Meet Ryan “I joined College in the Fourth Form, I was at an international school in Hong Kong before I joined College. When my parents and I were looking to study overseas, the spa town of Cheltenham really stood out to us with its regency architecture and unique scenery. The school itself also had a lot of features that stood out such as its facilities and its proximity to the town centre. I think the availability of your teachers and tutors has really supported me throughout college. You are always able to find a teacher in your subject within the department or within your boarding house to help you with whatever issues you have with your work. “ Why Study at Cheltenham College Sixth Form?
